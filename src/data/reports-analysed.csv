She was detained under various sections of the Mental Health Act 1983. Her last admission was to the Cygnet facility in Sheffield where her detention was pursuant to section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Whilst an inpatient, she showed improvement in various aspects of her mental health, probably due to the administration of the atypical antipsychotic drug, aripiprazole. She was at a point in her life where she was making a transition between children’s and adolescent mental health services and adult services. She was adamant in her refusal to engage with adult mental health services. Concern exists about the provision of assistance and support measures including S117 aftercare, a care programme approach, capacity assessments and the Vulnerable Adults Risk Management process. There was also valid concern about the lack of documentation and poor communication between services and partner organisations. Whilst many of these matters are true or partially true, no causation flows from them. The issue of cessation of aripiprazole therapy may have more than minimally, trivially or negligibly resulted in increased emotional instability leading to impulsive behaviour, but this was one of a number of issues which may have contributed to her death on 3rd November 2021. Chloe was found [REDACTED] by her brother at her home address on 3rd November 2021. He cut her down, commenced cardiopulmonary resuscitation and called the ambulance service who attended promptly. Following assessment by the paramedics, Chloe displayed signs unequivocally associated with death and this was confirmed at 17:05 hours on 3rd November 2021. The unpredictability of impulsive behaviour associated with evolving emotionally unstable personality disorder, coupled with Chloe’s lack of engagement with provided services or services that may have been offered, makes it probable that there was no realistic opportunity to prevent her death. Moreover, there was no indication that she could be detained under any of the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983, and hence be the subject of compulsory treatment. Whilst her decision to suspend herself may have been impulsive, she nevertheless intended her actions to result in her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Extensive evidence was heard by the court in the form of written and oral evidence, including expert evidence.
 
Of particular significance for the purpose of this report are the following matters:
 
There were repeated failures by nursing and medical staff to read, understand and replicate plans around safety off the ward or unit, which erroneously led to Gareth being permitted leave when he should not have been.
Part of the reason for this was a lack of joined up policy and risk management around how safety on leaving the unit or ward was being assessed in the case of voluntary patients creating ambiguity according to the RCA review.",,"On the 4th – 8th August 2025 evidence was heard touching the death of Gareth Ian JACKSON. He died on 22nd June 2022 aged 44 years.
 
 
Medical Cause of Death
 
I (a) Multiple Traumatic Injuries
 
How, when, where Gareth Ian JACKSON came by his death:
 
In February 2022 following infection from CoVid Gareth Jackson began to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression which led to him seeking medical help from his GP. He was prescribed sertraline in March 2022 but he stopped taking this. He did engage with some talking therapies. He began to deteriorate further during April into May 2022. He was ruminating on failures he perceived at work, and around financial worries. In June 2022 he tied a ligature [REDACTED]. On 13th June 2022 Gareth Jackson travelled to [REDACTED] with the intention to end his life. He did not do so and after speaking to police and a local mental health nurse, he returned to his home in London. Throughout February to June 2022 his wife Donna and his family did all they could to seek help and treatment for him. Later on the night of 13th June into 14th June he was assessed by local mental health nurses and agreed to attend the Coral Unit at Springfield Hospital, Glenburnie Road, SW17 7DJ where he was assessed. It was concluded he was at high risk of suicide. Gareth agreed to remain at the Coral Unit and the plan was to transfer him to the Lotus Unit at the hospital for further assessment. He was transferred to Lotus where he remained until 21st June 2022 which it is admitted was longer than he should have done while waiting for an inpatient bed due to a national bed crisis. He remained at high risk of suicide throughout. He remained a voluntary patient and a plan was made by a consultant psychiatrist from Lotus to admit him to Ward 2 at Springfield, an acute mixed adult psychiatric ward. If he wished to leave the hospital temporarily the plan was he should be escorted by a staff member or his wife. He agreed to this plan. This requirement was included in his treatment plan and was to remain the plan until it was altered by a consultant.  On his transfer to Ward 2 there was an inadequate handover and a failure to ensure this part of the plan was communicated properly to nursing staff. On ward 2 he was assessed by doctors as part of the clerking arrangements and again this part of the plan was inadequately recorded in the clerking notes and not properly handed over to nursing and medical staff. This led to a failure by nursing and medical staff on ward 2 on 22nd June 2022 to properly understand the plan, or to properly review the consultant note of 20th June 2022, and as a result to properly understand the risks Gareth posed to himself and the measures that needed to be in place to protect his life. As a consequence when Gareth requested unescorted leave on 22nd June 2022 he was permitted to leave the hospital unescorted because medical and nursing staff had failed to identify the plan for him not to leave unescorted. It is accepted by the Trust that: (i) there was a lack of clear procedure in place for handover on internal transfers at the time of Gareth’s death; (ii) there was a lack of clear procedure in place for handover between outgoing/incoming teams on Ward 2; (iii) there were shortcomings in the record keeping relating to Gareth’s transfer to Ward 2 from Lotus and the communications that followed; (iv) the plan implemented by the Consultant Psychiatrist on Lotus was not followed pending further senior review on Ward 2; (v) there was a failure to assess Gareth adequately on 22nd June 2022 following requests for unescorted leave; (vi) the requests for leave on 22nd June 2022 should not have been approved, pending a review by a senior doctor or consultant; (vii) Gareth should not have been granted unescorted leave from the Ward on the occasions this was granted on 22nd June 2022 and that had Gareth not been granted unescorted leave on that day his tragic suicide would likely have been prevented.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.  It is for each addressee to respond to matters relevant to them.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

pending,13/08/2025,07/08/2025,2025-0416,Tracey Ostler,Miss Caroline Topping,Assistant Coroner,Surrey,Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards) | Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths | Mental Health related deaths,Department of Health and Social Care | Health Services Safety Investigations Body | NHS South West London Integrated Care Board | Health and Care Professions Council | Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust | South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust | Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,7,0,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/tracey-ostler-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tracey-Ostler-Prevention-of-Future-Deaths-Report-2025-0416.pdf,,"1. Tracey Ostler suffered from Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder at the severe end of the spectrum. This made her extremely emotionally dysregulated and impulsive. From 2003 onwards she presented to accident and emergency 320 times typically having self-harmed. She had taken numerous serious overdoses. She was under the care of the community mental health team and was subject to a positive risk-taking plan aimed at maintaining her in the community. Following an admission to hospital earlier in 2023 she was upset because some of her belongings were missing. This triggered a number of episodes of self-harm and overdoses.
 
2. On the 12th June 2023 she was taken to Epsom General Hospital having taken an overdose and cut her wrists. On the 13th June 2023 she was assessed under the Mental Health Act 1983 and recommendations were made that she be detained under s2 of the act. No mental health hospital bed was available for her, so she remained in the emergency department, nursed one to one.
 
3. On the 16th June 2023 she was told that her belongings had been found and were being delivered to her home. She was assessed by two consultant psychiatrists who knew her from the community and home treatment teams. They decided that her mental state was improved and agreed she go home. She remained a high risk in the community, and it was predictable that if her belongings were not returned as she hoped she would harm herself.
 
4. She left hospital at noon and at 13.01 rang the community team telling them her belongings had been returned damaged. At 13.08 she rang the hospital extremely upset, threatening to take an overdose. Police were called and asked to undertake a welfare check. Ms Ostler also contacted the social services mental health team. An ambulance was called.
 
5. The Police found Ms Ostler in bed surrounded by empty medicine packages claiming to have taken [REDACTED] and some [REDACTED].  When the paramedics arrived, Ms Ostler refused to go to hospital with them. They were unaware of her diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and had no knowledge of the effect it may have on her ability to make informed choices. They did not seek any clinical advice about her mental health. Contrary to their protocol the paramedics made the decision that she had capacity to decline hospital treatment without any clinical input.  Thereafter the paramedics contacted her community mental health team for safety netting advice. They did not tell the community team they intended to leave her at home and were not told that her mental health disorder may impact on her capacity to make the decision to refuse medical treatment. The paramedics left her at home at 15.00.
 
6. The Home Treatment team who had care of her on the 16th June 2023 was not informed of these events. At 16.12 her care coordinator called her to talk about the damaged belongings. Ms Ostler did not answer the phone. She assumed she was in hospital and took no further action.
 
7. On the 17th June 2023 Ms Ostler was found unconscious at home and taken to hospital. Despite appropriate treatment she died at St Heliers Hospital on the 18th June 2023. If she had been conveyed to hospital before 20.00 on the 16th June 2023 she would have had effective treatment for the overdose and would not have died.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In   my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
In light of the failings I identified, I invited evidence to be filed in relation to any improvements that have been put in place to ameliorate these matters.
 
Evidence was provided by Epsom General Hospital, Surrey and Borders Partnership Trust and South East Coast Ambulance Service.
 
The organisations have taken the matters that led to Ms Ostler’s death seriously.
 
However, some of the matters I have raised have not been capable of resolution since the inquest concluded, and proposed improvements could therefore not be evidenced, although some are being planned.
 
I therefore remain concerned as follows:
 
Lack of Psychiatric Hospital Beds in Surrey and arrangements for detaining patients assessed to require Mental Health Act section in the Emergency Department of Epsom General Hospital : ,
 
Addressed to Epsom General Hospital, Surrey and Borders Partnership , South West London Integrated Care Board and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
 
1. I heard evidence that there is an acknowledged concern in Epsom General Hospital’s emergency department that patients with psychiatric presentations, who are assessed to require compulsory admission under the Mental Health Act 1983, are detained without being under section in the emergency department awaiting psychiatric beds. The longest wait by such a patient in these circumstances has been 6 weeks. There have been up to 10 psychiatric patients at any one time being held in the emergency department awaiting a psychiatric bed.
 
2. I remain concerned that there in no plan to stop this practice and that therefore:
 
a). Psychiatric patients in an acute state are being held in an unsuitable environment without access to appropriate ward based care under a multi-disciplinary psychiatric team.","An inquest into the death of Tracey Ostler was opened on the 24th August  2023 and resumed on the 25th April 2025. The inquest was concluded on the 23rd May 2025.

1a. Multiple Organ Failure
1b. [REDACTED] Toxicity
 II.  Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder

Whilst Mr Lawrence was a resident at Eastcroft Nursing Home he was not recorded as having sustained any falls until 21 December 2022, when his falls alarm went off in his bedroom and he was found crawling around on the floor.  It was recorded that he had new bruising to the left-hand side of his face.  He also reported rib pain, albeit that was not recorded in the records.  On 23 December 2022 he began to complain of abdominal pain and on 24 and 25 December 2022, he remained in bed all day.  On the evening of 25 December 2022, an ambulance was called and Mr Lawrence was transferred to St. Helier Hospital.   
 
Thereafter, Mr Lawrence had a CT scan which found multiple left sided acute rib fractures, which had caused a haemopneumothorax.  The CT scan also identified a number of other old fractures, including fractures to the spine, ribs and sternum.

On the 19th May 2024 Robert Gray English was electrocuted when the power supply to the rails was Switched on over a section of track between Hendon Central Station and Burnt Oak Underground, (covering Colindale Station), which he had been travelling down on foot in the dark.

The police officers saw him climb up a part of the fence but was not able to say whether he had climbed over. Members of the public, when the officers passed them, gave in answer to their questions the impression that Mr English had left the trackside and was in the park. This was factually incorrect as neither officer saw Mr English climb over the fence into the park. The officers believed that this might have been the case and made their way to the park where they were told by a member of the public that a person has been seen on the railway side of the fence.
 
Whilst the officers had left to look for Mr English in the park the Local Station Manager was asked to go to the platform and confirm that the police officers were still on the platform by a Service Manager and for confirmation that Mr English had left the track area.
 
The Local Station Manager confirmed that the police had left and that the passenger was nowhere to be seen and that the police did say that he climbed over the fences and has left the tracks.  The Service Manager asked the Local Station Manager to contact the controller on his behalf so the power to the track can be switched on.
 
The requirements within the rule book when switching the power supply to the rails were not followed in particular telling all the relevant people that the power supply to the rails is about to be switched on. This would have given the Police and British Transport Police an opportunity to confirm that Mr English had not been found and was likely still on the railway side of the tracks. It is likely that had this step been followed the power supply would not have been switched on and a proper search, which was also possible, is likely to have found Mr English and returned him safely to the station.",,"On the 24th May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of, Robert Grey English, aged 32.

Support workers, staff and Melissa raised concerns about [REDACTED]’s behaviour generally and specifically that Melissa was frightened of him.
 
On 12th October at about 11.40pm, [REDACTED] and Melissa had already gone to their bedrooms, [REDACTED] was unsupervised, when staff heard a loud bang. One of them said …” I ran up the stairs and opened the fire door, Melissa was on her back, her legs were slightly skew whiff. Her head was slightly to one side facing the stairs, I could see one eye which was open and there was a cut above it, I could see marks around her neck which were very red. She was fully clothed and she appeared dead…”","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
(1) the offer of placement and the level of supervision i.e. 1:1 was misleading, there was no clarification for example, 24hrs cover, 8hrs cover during the day only, or when carrying out activities or when outside the home only.
(2) there was no formal induction period set for residents with formal weekly reviews
(3) there was no formal review of the support plan and risk assessment especially during the induction period.","On 7th January 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Melissa Louise Mathieson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th July 2025.
 
The medical cause of death was:
 
1a) Severe hypoxic ischaemic brain injury associated with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with features highly suggestive of neck compression
 
The conclusion of the inquest was a short form with a narrative which read as follows:
 
“Melissa died as a result of unlawful killing caused by both the act of strangulation and also due to the acts and omissions by the home entrusted with her care.  
The home failed Melissa in numerous ways: the resident who went on to strangle her should not have been placed in the same facility as Melissa, at all, based on his known risks. The decision was wrongly made to place him in the same facility with an ineffective care plan and risk assessment, with staff that were not trained on his level of risk, and managers who failed to act when concerns were highlighted by staff and Melissa.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Alexandra Homes Ltd have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15th September 2025.

Chris’ death was drug related in that the post-mortem confirmed that he had taken a substantial, but not necessarily fatal amount of his prescribed Methadone that led to his central nervous systems including breathing and heart rate being slowed down.  Common side effects are nausea and vomiting with the vomit being aspirated causing obstruction of Chris’ airway leading to asphyxia and death.
 
I found that the following factors more than minimally contributed to his decision to take that medication.
 
Firstly, that Christopher had suffered for a number of years with drug and alcohol abuse and with his mental health, for which he had been prescribed medication.  Christopher had stated that he had stopped taking the medication leading to a return of paranoia and a persecution complex leading to Chris believing it was not safe for him to live at Canal House [REDACTED] but Chris did not have any alternative accommodation to go to on 12 December 2023.
 
Secondly, that Chis had a stockpile of Methadone in his room which he had access to as from 11 December 2023 and consumed one half of, leading to the sequence of events that caused his death, despite the risk of that stockpile, being recognised beforehand.
 
During the course of the Inquest, I heard evidence from [REDACTED] a Mental Health Support Worker at Canal House that she had had a discussion with [REDACTED] Christopher’s Recovery Co-Ordinator with the local Substance Misuse Team, that Chris had a stockpile of Methadone medication in his room and that she was concerned at the risk that it posed.  In evidence [REDACTED] said that she had spoken to Christopher about agreeing to giving up the medication and returning it to a pharmacy but as he had not consented, that had not happened.  She also believed that she had raised it with her manager, but the view was, that as Christopher had not consented to the medication being confiscated there was nothing they could do.","The issue that I had was that there appeared to be no basis for or consideration of the supported living accommodation provider, taking action to provide safeguarding for Christopher by removing the excess medication so that it was not within his control.  I was informed by [REDACTED] that the supported living accommodation provider did not allow staff to hold any medication even if it was done with the intention of providing safeguarding to someone, who by all accounts, was undergoing a mental health crisis.
 
I would hope that the organisation will review its policies as to what action (if any) it can take when it is made aware of a risk to a resident, rather than to only take action with the resident’s consent.","On 14 December 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher John O’Donnell and I opened an Inquest into his death on 30 September 2024.  On 18 July 2025 I concluded Christopher’s Inquest.   I found the medical cause of death was as follows:
 
1a.  Asphyxia due to Airway Obstruction by Vomit
1b.  Drug Toxicity
 
By way of a conclusion, I recorded a short form conclusion of drug related and as to when where and how (by what means Christopher came by his death) I provided the following:
 
Christopher John O’Donnell (Chris) lived in supported living accommodation at Canal House, [REDACTED]. Chris had a past medical history which included drug and alcohol abuse, together with mental health issues, for which he had been prescribed medication. In November 2023, Chris admitted that he had not taken his medication for some months, leading to a noticeable return of his paranoia and persecution complex, resulting in Chris believing wrongly, that it was not safe for him to remain at Canal House., but he had no alternative accommodation to go to.
 
On the 12 December 2023, Chris was found deceased in a communal lounge at Canal House, having consumed a substantial, but not fatal amount of his methadone medication, that he had been allowed access to, notwithstanding the recognised risks, which had led to him vomiting and being asphyxiated by his airway being obstructed by vomit.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September 2025.  I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Ms Theobald was killed over 18 months ago.

The home was equipped with a platform lift, intended for transporting wheelchair users accompanied by a carer. It was also used to move bulky equipment, although care home policy prohibited staff from travelling in the lift with equipment.
 
For reasons that remain unclear, Miss Langworthy entered the lift with stand aid. As the lift descended, the wheels of the stand aid caught on the edge of the lift platform, causing it to become wedged and pin Miss Langworthy against the wall of the lift shaft. Although she was able to call for help, Miss Langworthy could not reach the controls. The platform continued to descend, suspending her mid-air.
By the time she was freed, she was unresponsive, and resuscitation was unsuccessful.
 
An experienced HSE engineer examined the lift and confirmed there were no mechanical defects in either the lift or the stand aid. The engineer found that, once the downward toggle switch had been activated, the platform continued to move under latch control, placing the controls out of Miss Langworthy’s reach, as she remained trapped above the platform. The platform could not be stopped via the control wall pressure switch while descending.
 
The engineer noted that such risks were known within the industry, with a history of wheelchair users being injured in similar circumstances. She explained that “hold-to-run” controls – now a requirement under current standards (BS EN 81-41:2010)—would likely have prevented the incident, as the passenger would be expected to release the control in the event of danger. However, the lift pre-dated this requirement (BS 6440:1999), and such standards are not applied retrospectively.",,,,,,[]

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
The inquest heard evidence that Doreen Swann was only in hospital at the point of her fall because her discharge had been delayed due to a shortage of a suitable social care placement. The evidence was that nursing/caring for high falls risk patients in an acute setting is challenging and resource intensive.
 
The evidence given to the inquest was that this delayed discharge and the ongoing risk it presents was not an isolated incident at TGH -as an example the evidence given was that there were regularly 30 plus patients with a delayed discharge over 3 weeks due to a lack of social care beds .The evidence indicated that this challenge was not unique to Tameside.
 
The evidence indicated that managing a falls risk and the consequential risk to life is better managed outside an acute setting once the clinical need for a hospital stay has passed.
 
Delayed discharges such as Doreen Swann’s reduces the availability of beds for other patients and creates a knock-on impact across the hospital particularly in relation to the Emergency Department.",On 16th January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Doreen Swann.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Evidence was heard that if a mental health screening assessment is carried out in one part of the country, the results and conclusions reach may not necessarily be immediately available in another part of the country, when a further assessment is carried out. Evidence suggested that such assessments capture important clinical information and the lack of availability of preceding data may adversely influence subsequent assessments. Screening may form the basis for onward referral for formal mental health assessments. Absence of vital background information could result in an incorrect prioritisation for onward referral as it did in this case.

He had multiple co-morbidities including end-stage renal failure, hypertension, heart failure and pleural effusion.  His granddaughter called 999 at 03:37.  Due to extreme demand on the London Ambulance Service (“LAS”), there was a significant delay in that call and a later 999 call being answered and there were significant delays in allocation and dispatch of ambulances. The 999 call was incorrectly triaged and received an inaccurate categorisation of the urgency of the response required.
 
Having been informed that an emergency ambulance was not immediately required and of the wait times for an ambulance, Mr Robinson made his own way in an Uber to the nearest urgent treatment centre (“UTC”) at Queen Mary’s Hospital. Upon arrival, he had a cardiac arrest. This was due to a massive myocardial infarction. After prolonged CPR and shocks by staff at the UTC and attending LAS paramedics, a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved at 05:04.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Evidence was heard that there is a lacuna in the law, specifically relating to section 17 of the Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) which grants police officers the power to enter and search premises without a warrant in specific situations. These include, inter alia, entry for arrest and emergency situations which allows entry to save life or limb or prevent serious damage to a property. In this particular case, evidence was heard that this man had not been seen for two months and there were concerns about his welfare and paramedics attended on one occasion but have no powers of entry. Due to the Right Care, Right Person model, which has been developed over the last few years, the police did not get involved, as it was thought by the concerned individual that this man not being seen was due to a medical problem. Evidence was heard which suggested that on occasions, the ambulance service and the fire service should have powers of entry in the event that a person who is ill, unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, with a remediable disorder, can receive prompt and potentially life-saving treatment. In this case, causation would not have been established as the man has been dead for several weeks, but situations could and will arise where time-sensitive pathological processes require emergency treatment to save life.","On 21st March 2025, I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Ramsden, aged 74 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26th June 2025.

pending,15/07/2025,07/07/2025,2025-0337,Sarah Lewis,Mrs Deborah Suzanne Rookes,Assistant Coroner,Avon,"Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths | Suicide (from 2015)",Department of Health and Social Care,1,0,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/sarah-lewis-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sarah-Lewis-Prevention-of-Future-Deaths-Report-2025-0337-1.pdf,,"In 2014, Sarah Lewis was diagnosed with Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Ms Lewis’ ME was severe and as a result of her condition, she experienced severe and debilitating symptoms. This had a huge effect on her quality of life, and left her for the most part bedbound. It also impacted on her ability to seek professional support or be supported due to sensory sensitivity and aversion to visiting, or being visited. Ms Lewis had a history of anxiety and depression but this complex multisystem condition resulted in a deterioration of her mental health and left her wishing that she was no longer alive.
 
On 8 August 2024, it was Severe ME Awareness Day. Ms Lewis was found deceased at home on 9 August 2024 but as she had not been seen for 2 days, it is likely she died the day before, on a day which was significant for her. Her death was caused by her taking an overdose of [REDACTED] with the intention of ending her own life. By ending her own life, she also ended the profound physical and mental suffering that she had endured.
 
I heard that due to the severe nature of her illness, nothing could really be done to help her. She was therefore left knowing that there is no real treatment for ME, and there is no cure.
 
Whilst there is an ME/CFS service provided by North Bristol , there are areas of the country where there is no provision.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  – 
 
1) Despite ME having received some more recent attention, the provision of ME services around the country remains inconsistent. I understand that there are still areas where there is no provision. The evidence revealed that a very important first stage for ME sufferers is that they receive a diagnosis and validation for their severe symptoms. Without provision of a service, there remains a risk that this will not occur. I was told that there is still a belief by some that ME is not real and this has a profoundly negative effect on sufferers and their ability to seek support.    
 
2) Historically, there has been little research into ME. As a result of this, nobody knows what causes it, and there is therefore no cure. Whilst I note there has been a small investment recently in research, I was told that this is not enough, and that a perception remains about ME not being real. The resultant effect is that some ME sufferers have no hope that their symptoms will ever improve.
 
3) Other professionals do not understand ME, what it is or the symptoms it causes. This can be a barrier to those with ME receiving support, or accessing care/treatment they need. A hospital passport is now being utilised at North Bristol, which assists sufferers. However, it is not clear that this is being used in all areas, and there remains a lack of understanding about ME. Education and training about this has not been prioritised.
 
4) NICE issued update guidance relatively recently but it is not clear whether this has been fully considered or implemented by commissioning bodies around the country.","On 27 August 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Sarah Jayne Lewis. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest today, on 7 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was:

He had a long cardiac history which included aortic dissection, multiple aortic aneurysms and heart failure. He first underwent surgery for aortic dissection in 2006.
 
He subsequently underwent further surgery on multiple occasions for further stenting and grafting to repair additional ruptures to his aorta. He developed an endoleak which was monitored and remained stable for many years, until it required surgery in 2023.
 
Mr Gifford died on 26 November 2024 at Southmead Hospital. His death was caused by an acute ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, following the development of a fractured stent and endoleak at some point in the weeks preceding his death. It was not clear for exactly how long this endoleak had been present, or when the fracture occurred.
 
In the weeks before his death, Mr Gifford had had multiple visits to his GP surgery. He was a complex patient with a number of medical condition and he had been experiencing a range of symptoms. The clinicians he saw referred him for further investigations into his symptoms.
 
In the afternoon of 25 November 2024, Mr Gifford made a 999 call to the ambulance due to right-sided neck pain which radiated down his back and to his flank. He had been experiencing this pain since August 2024. Paramedics attended in the evening, and after an assessment, they did not think he needed to be conveyed to hospital. Worsening advice was given which resulted in Mr Gifford calling 999 again late that evening and an ambulance arrived in the early hours of 26 November 2024. He was conveyed to hospital and then transferred to Southmead Hospital, where he lost cardiac output whilst still on the trolley.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  – 
 
Training and knowledge focuses on the classic signs and symptoms associated with an AAA. However, there are a group of patients who will not present in this way, and who may be challenging to diagnose. Whilst there may be many medical conditions that could be similar, there does not seem to be much focus given to the identification of vascular emergencies within training and knowledge updates. Therefore when paramedics attend emergencies, in the absence of classic symptoms, they may be wrongly reassured. Where a person has an extensive aortic history, the importance of aortic pathology should be considered.  
 
There has not been training or medical education for ambulance on vascular emergencies for a long time. The evidence was that JRCALC guidelines did recently highlight the number of patients that may not present with the traditional ‘red flags’ but did not provide further guidance. This is a national issue where ambulance staff should be knowledgeable about the more subtle signs of vascular emergencies that may be missed.","On 3 December 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of David Stewart Gifford.

In the last few years of his life he suffered a decline in his physical health (most notably due to dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation), which together with work stresses caused a decline in his mental health. He attended a holistic BUPA assessment in December 2023. The BUPA report highlighted stress levels and a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation which required prompt attention. Both health concerns were reported to Mr. Hatchett’s general practitioner. In response to the BUPA report, Mr. Hatchett’s GP directed him to A&E to obtain urgent treatment for the atrial fibrillation. Treatment was provided by the A&E team in the form of anticoagulation. The GP surgery did not action the recommendation for primary care psychotherapy and/or follow-up of his mental health to address his levels of stress. Mr. Hatchett did not present to any of the healthcare professionals as being at risk of suicide or at risk of deliberate self-harm, but he was not expressly questioned about his mental health. There was a missed opportunity to refer him for therapy in January 2024 and/or for the GP to follow up on Mr. Hatchett’s mental health.

His death was completely unexpected.
 
As his cause of death was not known a postmortem examination was conducted including toxicology. The pathologist’s opinion was that Aaron had died due to a seizure and positional asphyxia.
 
Aaron’s mother was doubtful of the cause of death proposed and pressed for a second postmortem which was undertaken by a different pathologist. That pathologist considered that a more likely cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia caused by Aaron’s prescription of Risperidone (for behavioural regulation), and Ritalin (for ADHD – attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).
 
On the court’s assessment of the evidence, applying the balance of probabilities, a probable medical cause of death cannot be determined.
 
The court notes that Aaron’s medication reviews to check for any complications were conducted in line with local health guidelines. Aaron’s last review took place in November 2021, but Aaron did not attend subsequent reviews which were offered.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.  In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Whilst Aaron had annual GP reviews related to prescription of anti-psychotic medication (Risperidone, although the inquest heard that prescription of Ritalin was also a relevant factor, particularly in combination with Risperidone), to check for signs of adverse side effects and physical health complications, those reviews did not include ECGs (electrocardiograms) to check for signs of adverse effects on electrical activity of the heart. On the medical evidence before the inquest antipsychotic medication carries recognised risk of QT interval prolongation and lethal cardiac arrhythmias.
 
It does not appear that the recognised risk of QT interval prolongation and lethal cardiac arrhythmias from long term prescription of antipsychotic medication is reflected in guidance to medical practitioners and prescribers, nationally or locally in terms of performing ECGs.
 
The relevant NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) guidance (web link below) refers to ECG testing under How should I monitor someone taking antipsychotics? and recommends Electrocardiography (ECG) – after dose changes. Ideally, also annually.
 
The local Derbyshire Integrated Care Board guidance (web link below) does not identify need for ECG to be included in annual monitoring in primary care unless if new medicines or changes to physical health have increased the risk of prolonged QTc arrange ECG.
 
It appears there is lack of clarity and consistency for annual reviews to include ECGs where people are prescribed antipsychotic medication long term. Given the recognised risks explained at inquest then not providing annual ECGs for long term users of those medications appears to pose risk of death.

Mr Kerslake’s fatal injuries were sustained when he was tasked by a different company to strim vegetation at two specific sites on the estate.
 
Having completed those two sites, he proceeded (uninstructed) to strim the vegetation at the foot of an electricity pylon on the estate.
 
The machinery used was a petrol-driven brush cutter with a metal blade.
 
In the course of strimming, Mr Kerslake cut through an 11kV electricity cable which was attached in the usual way to one of the vertical wooden poles of the pylon.  The blade of the machine cut through the cable guard and the cable itself, causing the electrical explosion in which Mr Kerslake was injured.

1a Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome
1b 52% Total Body Surface Area Burns
1c Electrical Explosion",,On 2 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Ernest Kerslake.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2025.  The conclusion of the inquest was: Accidental Death.,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 20 August 2025.

The  evidence revealed that on 31 March 2020 Mrs Lewis was triaged in the emergency department North Devon District Hospital (NDDH) at 1402hrs; it was noted that she attended following a stroke,  describing the onset of right sided facial droop and right sided arm and leg weakness at 1300hrs.
 
The hospital had been pre-alerted as this was a potentially time critical episode.
 
Mrs Lewis was assessed by the duty consultant and a junior Dr.  Her symptoms and signs were noted and it was recognised that she was not eligible for thrombolysis (clot busting medication) as she was taking rivaroxaban.  She also had a stroke severity assessment score calculated as less than 5, this is a national score based on the symptoms and is used to guide immediate treatment options.  This score meant that she would not benefit from a thrombectomy (the removal of clots by mechanical retrieval). This is a procedure only performed in Derriford in Plymouth or Bristol Hospital by an interventional neuroradiologist, this is a specialist and highly skilled procedure. 
 
Following a CT scan Mrs Lewis deteriorated further with worsening weakness and the addition of speech problems. This deterioration meant that she was now eligible for thrombectomy,  however this was not available at NDDH at that time and she had missed the window of opportunity for a referral to Derriford which was 1500hrs. The inquest heard evidence that at the time there was no further possibility of referral.
 
Evidence was also heard that the current situation is that the cut off time for referral is now 16.30hrs.
 
A thrombectomy can reduce the risk of severe disability or permanent damage caused by blood clots, restore blood flow to vital organs and can potentially prevent limb loss or death in acute cases.","The concerns relate to the provision of the thrombectomy procedure to patients suffering with a stroke in the South West.
 
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The evidence revealed that there is a gap in the availability of the time critical and potentially lifesaving thrombectomy emergency procedure to patients that have suffered a severe stroke in the South West.",On  16 July 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Greta Mary Ann Lewis. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 10-11 June 2025.  The conclusion of the inquest was that Greta Ann Lewis died as a consequence of complications of a stroke.  The short form conclusion of natural causes was recorded.,"Consideration should be given to reviewing the availability of thrombectomy procedures in the south west and consider the viability of a 24/7 service.
 
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11th August 2025  I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Whilst the evidence did not disclose the source of the codeine taken in excess prior to his death, the evidence positively confirmed that, absent concomitantly raised paracetamol levels, the codeine identified in the toxicological analysis was likely not from the medication prescribed by the deceased’s GP Practice.  Accordingly, no direct causative link could be found, to the requisite standard of proof, between the prescribed medication itself and the death and, further, no finding or determination was made that was critical of the GP’s on-going prescribing of the pain-killing medication. However, the lack of specialist support to which the GP could refer the patient was a significant concern.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern and in my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Notwithstanding the positive finding that the specific medication prescribed by  Mr Barry’s GP had not been the source of the excessive codeine taken prior to admission to hospital, compelling evidence was received at the inquest from  a Partner at the GP Practice (with a particular specialism in this area of dependency-forming medications) that there remains no specialist commissioned service available for GPs to which they might refer their patients to manage reduction of their intake of prescribed dependency-forming medications.  This is in contrast to the availability of commissioned services for patients who are dependent on illicit drugs and/or alcohol.
 
The evidence confirmed that reduction or cessation of dependency-forming medications needs to be very carefully managed due to the risk of withdrawal symptoms and, in the context of the unchallenged evidence received, requires specialist input and training to maximise the prospects of success and to avoid potentially fatal consequences.  The evidence, again unchallenged, was that the continuing absence of such a commissioned service gives rise to the risk of avoidable future deaths.
 
The long-standing and continuing lack of commissioned services in primary or secondary care for assisting people to safely reduce and withdraw from such prescribed medication was confirmed in her evidence by the Director of Pharmacy and Medicines Optimisation within the Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board (the ICB).  This witness helpfully set out important steps currently proposed and/or being taken to educate clinicians and service users alike of the dangers of opiate based prescription medications (alongside their relatively limited benefits in most, though not all, cases) with a view to reducing the size of the cohort of patients at risk of becoming dependent/addicted in the medium and longer term.  However, this does not – absent a commissioned service to which GPs and patients may turn for specialist advice and assistance – address the immediate and on-going risk of future deaths to those currently dependant on/addicted to these medications, with the numbers of such patients having significantly increased in the post-COVID 19 period as a consequence of lengthy delays to, for example, chronic pain-relieving surgery.
 
Precisely this issue was highlighted in a previous PFD Report from 14th November 2019 issued by the former Senior Coroner in this jurisdiction.  The response from the (then) Clinical Commissioning Group had indicated an intention to roll-out a Prescribed Opioid Dependence Local Enhanced Service in early 2020, but this was not implemented due to the COVID 19 pandemic.
 
Since then, including at the date of Mr Barry’s death in November 2023 and through to today, there remains no such, or similar, commissioned service across Essex or, it appears, consistently across England and Wales with only rare pockets around the country where such a service is commissioned.","On 8th September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Paul Barry aged 46 years.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 30th May 2025. Mr Barry died at Broomfield Hospital, Court Road, Chelmsford, Essex from a confirmed medical cause of death, following Post Mortem examination, of ‘Ia Pneumonia’ and, under Part II (as having contributed to the death but not a direct cause): ‘Excessive use of Codeine’.
 
I provided a Narrative Conclusion confirming that the deceased died, despite optimal medical care following admission to Hospital, from fatal complications of a community acquired pneumonia on a background of excessive use of Codeine medication. 
 
Notwithstanding evidence of the deceased’s history of mental health issues and previous suicidal ideation, and an attempt to take his own life by way of overdose some three months prior to his death, the evidence did not disclose to the requisite standard of proof the deceased’s intent at the time of taking excessive codeine medication in the period prior to his last hospitalisation.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Thursday August 7th 2025.

When she was found unresponsive in her bed during the night, the alarm was raised and a number of people attended to try to resuscitate her. There were also some concerns and criticisms of the resuscitation efforts, including raised at the time by the ambulance service personnel. On the facts of this case, any such failings did not play a part in the death and further, the Trust concerned has tried to improve the situation by providing better training and better prioritisation of this. Additionally, at least one of those employed health care workers was not up- to- date on her basic life support training.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

(1) There is no system that prevents staff that are non- compliant with mandatory training, including basic life support training, from being able to work on EPUT in- patient wards.

As I have outlined above, this was an ‘immediate’ priority search to obtain the address of a young woman whose life was believed to be at risk.
 
It is hard to understand the decision (made by more than one police caller) not to leave any voicemail/message.
 
We heard evidence from two police Inspectors (one from Avon and Somerset Constabulary and one from Surrey Police) that although there is guidance in Avon not to leave voicemails when the incident in question concerns domestic abuse, there is no general guidance about when to leave a voicemail message in other cases (ie, it is neither encouraged not discouraged by any policy or standard operating procedure).
 
I was subsequently provided with an updated ‘Deployment of Resources Procedure’ from Surrey Police, which indicates that ‘call takers and dispatchers must consider whether it is appropriate to leave a voicemail, unless there is a compelling operational reason not to do so’.  It is not clear from the title of the document or the wording of the guidance whether this is intended to affect police officers, or only the actions of those in Surrey’s contact centre and force control room.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – 
 
With limited or no guidance, training or policy on when police and/or police support staff liaising with the public should leave a voicemail (particularly in circumstances where they are trying to obtain important information in a timepressured situation), I am concerned that there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 August 2025.  I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Her mother has type 1 diabetes which is known to increase the risk of congenital heart defect. Her mother’s identical twin had a congenital heart defect identified at birth. No cardiac defects were noted at her anomaly scan. Following her birth she was admitted to the neonatal unit when she showed signs of infection. She required respiratory support and antibiotics. An echocardiogram was not carried out because she responded to treatment and her requirement for oxygen support decreased. An echocardiogram would have identified the defect. She was discharged home. She was seen by General Practitioners on three occasions and by the community midwifery service. She did gain weight but the trajectory of her weight gain was not recognised as being a concern. Her feeding declined and she had episodes of vomiting. On 17th March 2024 her parents became increasingly concerned about her, due to her overall appearance and an eye twitch they detected. At Stepping Hill Hospital it was identified by the nurse that she was unwell. She was given Oxygen and seen by clinicians. She was diagnosed with Bronchitis and appeared to respond to treatment, although remained very unwell. She suddenly stopped breathing. Attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful and she died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 17th March 2024. A post mortem examination found that she had a ventricular septal defect that had led to her death. Earlier identification of the defect would probably have meant she would not have died when she did.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
The inquest heard evidence that health visitors /midwives and GPs play a key role in the early identification of a heart defect such as Esme’s at an early stage. Such a defect will rarely be apparent at the 72 hour check on the evidence given at the inquest but symptoms will manifest subsequently. Such symptoms can be subtle and the inquest was told that for there to be early suspicion, of a heart defect, training for community midwives/health visitors and GPs needed to be improved and good quality information sharing was also essential. This should include concerns around feeding and weight loss.
 
The GP check at 6- 8 weeks was a key checking point but needed to be informed by asking all of the right questions and a good understanding of how to listen for such a heart defect.
 
The inquest was told that it was important that it was understood by health professionals involved in the care of a baby that the mother being diabetic increased the risk of a defect significantly and should increase the care taken in relation to presenting symptoms.
 
There was no routine echocardiogram of a baby born of a mother with diabetes nationally although their risk of a defect was significantly higher than other babies and such a test it would detect a baby with a ventricular septal defect at an early stage
 
In Esme’s case although her mum’s identical twin had a heart defect this did not in the North West, trigger the protocol for a routine echocardiogram. A heart defect in her mother would have. It was unclear why this was excluded given the genetic link.
 
Esme had the usual abnormality scan which the inquest was told did not detect the defect on her heart. The inquest was told that the cardiac part of the abnormality scan was not audited in England under national guidance and the cardiac images were not stored. This meant they were not available for subsequent examination.
 
The evidence of the paediatricians at the inquest was that tracking weight on the centile chart even from an early point assisted in understanding if there was a significant issue in relation to feeding triggering professional curiosity. However the evidence from the Health Visitor appeared to suggest that centile tracking was not seen as useful before 1 month and the red book was not used to look at weight centile tracking in the early stages.",On 2nd April 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Esme Vera Louise ATKINSON. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8th May 2025.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.  In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 
  
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
(brief summary of matters of concern) 
 
1. [REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: 
a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. 
b. The published Guidance (commenced in 2014 and updated in August 2024) does not give specific guidance or suggested training to sellers, particularly [REDACTED] acquired by members of the public, particularly over ‘online marketplaces’ in circumstances of the purchase on a ‘one off’ basis for the means of self-harming. 
c. Whilst there is a legal duty on persons selling this substance to report “suspicious” transactions within 24 hours to the Home Office, the purchase of small quantities is being presumed to be connected to the many legitimate uses of the substance (such as food preservation, fertilizer etc) rather than in fact, being evaluated as a member of the public seeking purchase of modest quantities used as their chosen means by which to end life. 
d. The current Home Office guidance and supporting video, leaflet and posters do not reference [REDACTED] as a specific example of concern and focuses on the phenomenon of ‘malicious’ misuse and not deliberate misuse in the sense of suicide/self-harm. 
 
2. The police investigation into one UK based source of supply revealed in 247 cases separate supplies of 500 grams of less of [REDACTED] to customers in the UK and Europe, police established that 85 of these individuals who were traceable had either died as the consequence of self-ingestion of the substance, or had purchased it with a view to having the means to use this method to end their life in circumstances where: 
a. the vendors of the [REDACTED] were not aware of this potential misuse of the substance. 
b. the small quantities being purchased had been incorrectly evaluated to be an increase in individuals pursuing recreational home-curing/food preservations as a hobby, being an artefact of ‘lockdown’ living following the COVID national pandemic emergency. 
c. Vendors were unaware that their website/details were being distributed as part of internet information platforms designed to aid, abet, assist or promote suicide methods. 
d. From the specific example of 247 supplies in a 12-month period, police established that 45 purchasers were confirmed as deceased (these deaths were in relation to supplies to UK customers and purchasers from abroad) and only 15 purchases were confirmed to have taken place for legitimate purposes (meat curing etc.). 
 
3. The police investigation revealed the ability of members of the public to access a number of websites, primarily created in the USA, Canada and Mexico that promoted information as to how to access: 
a. Poisons that could bring about death 
b. How, in what way and with other necessary preparations (in particular -antiemetic medications) the poisons should be administered. 
c. Sourcing such poisons/chemicals/medications in the UK and abroad.","On 14 August 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew Alexander Roger BROWN aged 45.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 April 2024. 
 
The medical cause of death was determined to be:
 
       1a [REDACTED] Toxicity
 
I returned a narrative conclusion that Andrew Alexander Roger BROWN died as the consequence of a self-administered quantity of [REDACTED] in circumstances where his intentions remain unclear.
 
Reporting restrictions were imposed in this case because of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America, the case being one of a cluster of eight similar cases upon the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction.
 
Reporting restrictions were lifted on the 19th of April 2024.
 
This report is being published following updates from Greater Manchester Police and suicide prevention organisations received on the 14th of March 2025.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report,
namely by May 16, 2025.  I, the coroner, may extend the period.
 
Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.  Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.",[]

He had been treated conservatively and discharged by local community-based mental health services following the deceased’s non-engagement.
 
In October 2022, a consultant psychiatrist assessed the deceased to be in a phase of gradual decline with fluctuating symptoms that included hallucinations with distorted thinking and perception suggestive of a prodromal insidious onset of a psychotic illness with decline in social functioning. The views of the psychiatrist were communicated to the deceased’s general practitioner, who having discussed matters with the deceased and his family, persevered with a conservative, reactive pathway of primary care and did not refer the deceased to further community mental health intervention as suggested by the psychiatrist, but whether this decision had any bearing upon the outcome remains unclear.
 
At 10.58pm on the 22nd of May 2021, North West Ambulance Service received an emergency call from the deceased, informing them that he had consumed an quantity of [REDACTED] with ‘metformin blue’ 15 minutes earlier, that he was now not breathing normally and in effect, he was seeking to be rescued. The call was categorised as a ‘Category 2’ response using the prevailing Medical Priority Dispatch System. By reason of operational conditions that evening, there was an 89-minute delay in response with an ambulance arriving on scene at 11.27pm. The deceased was found collapsed, unresponsive in room 49 of the hotel. He failed to respond to resuscitation and was confirmed as dead at 11.37pm.
 
Police investigations established that the deceased had booked into the hotel at about 9pm that night and had earlier acquired the [REDACTED] using the internet from a source in Russia. No note or other evidence of intention was discovered. Toxicological samples from the deceased confirmed the presence of significant levels of alcohol and a fatally toxic amount of [REDACTED], albeit the precise quantity or time of ingestion could not be quantified. The consequence of the delayed paramedic response cannot be established due to the rapidity of effect and highly toxic consequence of methemoglobinemia that arises following ingestion of [REDACTED].","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.  In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 
  
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
(brief summary of matters of concern) 
 
1. [REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: 
a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. 
b. The published Guidance (commenced in 2014 and updated in August 2024) does not give specific guidance or suggested training to sellers, particularly [REDACTED] acquired by members of the public, particularly over ‘online marketplaces’ in circumstances of the purchase on a ‘one off’ basis for the means of self-harming. 
c. Whilst there is a legal duty on persons selling this substance to report “suspicious” transactions within 24 hours to the Home Office, the purchase of small quantities is being presumed to be connected to the many legitimate uses of the substance (such as food preservation, fertilizer etc) rather than in fact, being evaluated as a member of the public seeking purchase of modest quantities used as their chosen means by which to end life. 
d. The current Home Office guidance and supporting video, leaflet and posters do not reference [REDACTED] as a specific example of concern and focuses on the phenomenon of ‘malicious’ misuse and not deliberate misuse in the sense of suicide/self-harm. 
 
2. The police investigation into one UK based source of supply revealed in 247 cases separate supplies of 500 grams of less of [REDACTED] to customers in the UK and Europe, police established that 85 of these individuals who were traceable had either died as the consequence of self-ingestion of the substance, or had purchased it with a view to having the means to use this method to end their life in circumstances where: 
a. the vendors of the [REDACTED] were not aware of this potential misuse of the substance. 
b. the small quantities being purchased had been incorrectly evaluated to be an increase in individuals pursuing recreational home-curing/food preservations as a hobby, being an artefact of ‘lockdown’ living following the COVID national pandemic emergency. 
c. Vendors were unaware that their website/details were being distributed as part of internet information platforms designed to aid, abet, assist or promote suicide methods. 
d. From the specific example of 247 supplies in a 12-month period, police established that 45 purchasers were confirmed as deceased (these deaths were in relation to supplies to UK customers and purchasers from abroad) and only 15 purchases were confirmed to have taken place for legitimate purposes (meat curing etc.). 
 
3. The police investigation revealed the ability of members of the public to access a number of websites, primarily created in the USA, Canada and Mexico that promoted information as to how to access: 
a. Poisons that could bring about death 
b. How, in what way and with other necessary preparations (in particular -antiemetic medications) the poisons should be administered. 
c. Sourcing such poisons/chemicals/medications in the UK and abroad.","On 30 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of William James Armstrong aged 24.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06 June 2023. 
The medical cause of death was determined to be:
 
1a. [REDACTED] Toxicity
 
I returned a narrative conclusion that William James Armstrong died as the consequence of the effects of a significant quantity of [REDACTED] deliberately self-administered in circumstances where his intentions remain unclear by reason of a combination of recently consumed alcohol and a prodromal insidious onset of an undiagnosed psychotic illness.

Attending police confirmed an absence of suspicious circumstances and recovered no note or other direct expression of her intent.
 
The deceased’s post-mortem samples revealed the presence of recently ingested and fatally toxic levels of [REDACTED] from which metabolised quantities of [REDACTED] was also noted to be present. The deceased had recently sourced and acquired a quantity of [REDACTED] from an internet-based supplier in Lithuania. Although the precise amount ordered and time this was done was not clear, from packaging at the scene it was established that it had been delivered recently to her usual address in Atherton that, in fact, she had not been occupying for several weeks prior to her death.
 
The deceased had a medical history that included episodic low mood and anxiety. Historically, she had been considered to have suffered from symptomologies of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Bi-Polar Affective Disorder, and phases of emotional dysregulation with previous episodes of attempted self-harm.
 
The evidence established that despite being considered to possess capacity, from October 2020 she had recently entered a phase of mental health deterioration with psychotic lapses, including delusional and disordered thoughts and actions. Her mental health condition had previously been treated actively by way of inpatient treatment and at the time of her death, her enduring significant risk of self-harm was being managed conservatively in the community. The actions that brought about her death were both deliberate and intentional, precipitated by multi-factorial stressors that included her enduring mental ill-health, financial concern and worry, recent peripatetic living arrangements away from her home and family, and matters arising from issues connected to elements of dysfunction from within a new domestic relationship.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She had a long history of treatment and care by her local Mental Health Trust that had included phases of both conservative community-based treatment and intensive crisis resolution home based treatment with 8 previous phases of both voluntary and involuntary hospital in-patient treatment and care. Her presentations had included enduring self-harming thoughts and actions with persistent suicidal ideation, previous overdose, impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, and auditory, visual and olfactory hallucination with pseudo-hallucinations within psychotic relapse phases that were diagnosed to be both trauma-induced and associated as a manifestation of her obsessive-compulsive disorder. The deceased had been in receipt of regular depot anti-psychotic medication.
 
Following her acquiring a quantity of [REDACTED] from an internet-based source, she had deliberately ingested a significant, but non-fatal dose on the basis of her using this substance as a form of self-harm in October 2019 culminating in her voluntary informal admission to the Keats Ward of the Meadowbrook Unit of Salford Royal Hospital, Stott Lane, Salford on the 26th of November 2019 where she received ongoing active care, supervision, treatment and monitoring. Had the deceased sought to be discharged or attempted to leave without clinical approval, it is likely that she would have been detained pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 because of her assessed high risk of self-harm.
 
In February 2020, the deceased had acquired a further quantity of [REDACTED] whilst on ward and self-ingested a small quantity by reason of an act of self-harm, informing healthcare staff of her actions resulting in medical intervention. A multidisciplinary team review meeting interpreted that she was using such overdoses as a method of communicating her ongoing distress. Healthcare staff were aware of the deceased’s ongoing possession of [REDACTED] and the high risk of self-harm with significant risk of deliberate or inadvertent overdose and her presumed or known possession of [REDACTED] was managed conservatively by reason of the deceased’s status as a voluntary inpatient who had been continually assessed to have capacity.
 
On the 29th of May 2020 at approximately 6.45am the deceased was observed in her room on Keats Ward in a collapsed, unresponsive and cyanosed condition. She was being observed hourly and had last been seen alive at about 6am. An immediate ‘crash call’ was made but she failed to respond to attempted resuscitation and was verified as dead at 7.20am that morning.
 
Post-mortem samples from the deceased revealed the presence of fatally toxic levels of both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], likely from a single batch of [REDACTED] the deceased had previously sourced, retained and hidden. The evidence does not establish the precise quantity or time she ingested the [REDACTED] but was analysed to be at levels that would rapidly, within minutes, precipitate unconsciousness, hypoxia and cardio-respiratory failure. The deceased had, incidentally, been properly prescribed promethazine – a sedating antihistamine to assist her sleep, that would also have produced an antiemetic effect. Police recovered no note or evidence of her intentions and were able to establish no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

He was seen post operatively to develop lymphoedema which is a recognised complication of the surgery.
He was referred for treatment of the lymphedema. This amongst other treatments required the wearing of compression garments.

Etta was born in poor condition at Ysbyty Gwynedd on 3 July 2023 where her Mother’s pregnancy was uneventful up until 21 June 2023 (40+1 gestational weeks). Static growth had not been identified by the community midwife at this time and therefore there was no referral to obstetrics. The static growth was not identified for a second time at 40+5 gestational weeks on 25 June 2023. Again, there was no referral to obstetrics. When Etta’s mother was 40+12, on 2 July, she arrived at the Maternity Outpatient Assessment Unit for induction of labour. It was not noted that there was static growth. She ought to have been referred to the labour ward for close monitoring. Instead, she was induced. She received intermittent monitoring. The holistic assessments were not always completed and not entirely complete, the partogram did not note baseline fetal heart rate only as required, the maternal pulse was not always taken and recorded and there was no recognition that Etta’s mother’s pulse was being recorded as opposed to the fetal heart rate. There were several gross failures identified in Etta’s mother’s care which resulted in opportunities not taken to deliver Etta before she became distressed. Etta was transferred to Arrowe Park Hospital for specialist neonatal care where she passed away 4 days later. There were many incidences of learning from a neonatal perspective relating to Etta’s resuscitation at Ysbyty Gwynedd.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. 
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows  –
 
The maternity and neonatal departments undertook an investigation into Etta’s mother’s care antenatally and after Etta’s delivery. The concerns are as follows:-
 
The neonatal investigation was not thorough. The investigator did not obtain or request statements from doctors directly involved in Etta’s resuscitation, nor did they meet with them to understand what had occurred. The investigation was based on records alone. The records themselves, identified as part of the investigation, were often incomplete or included retrospective entries. Despite this, the investigator nor the panel involved considered speaking to or obtaining statements from crucial individuals.
 
There was no sufficiently full contextual sharing of the investigation or its findings from a neonatal or maternity perspective. Some witnesses had only received and read the report several weeks prior to the Inquest.
 
The memoranda sent to staff highlighting the learning did not include context or narrative around the circumstances of investigation. Therefore, those not directly involved would not have been fully aware of the context of what had occurred.
 
Having issued Reports to the Health Board regarding quality of investigation previously, this concern remains. Specifically, I have concerns that the neonatal element of the investigation was not thorough enough such that without this genuine learning and change will not and cannot occur. Even where learning has been shared, I am concerned that this is not contextualised sufficiently. I am also concerned that staff not involved in the incident will not learn fully enough from events where there is inadequate sharing of learning from an incident.","On 20 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Etta-Lili Stockwell-Parry (DOB 3/7/23) who passed away on 7 July 2023 (having received a transfer from the Coronial jurisdiction where Etta passed away). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 May 2025.  A narrative conclusion was recorded with the cause of death as:-
 
1a Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
 
Etta Lili Stockwell-Parry was born at 40+13 gestational weeks on 3 July 2023 at 00:51 at Ysbyty Gwynedd in poor condition following an instrumental assisted birth. Etta was transferred later that day to Arrowe Park Hospital, Liverpool for specialist neonatal support where she passed away on 7 July 2023 as a result of inutero compromise which led to the condition from which she died. There were several opportunities not taken by those caring for Etta’s mother antenatally including at 40+1 gestational weeks and at 40+5 gestational weeks and at 40+12 gestational weeks to escalate from a midwife to a registrar due to static growth which would have led to induction of labour and likely safe delivery of Etta. There were opportunities to identify concerns with Etta through her mother on the midwifery led unit on 2 July 2023 including properly conducting holistic assessments, properly completing partogram and manual palpation of maternal pulse which would also likely have resulted in earlier detection of distress and successful delivery. Etta’s death was contributed to by neglect.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 16 July 2025.

In 2010, some 13 and a half years earlier, Mr Spencer had suffered from a right inguinal hernia.  This was recorded in his GP medical history.  The GP medical history was not available to the GP out of hours surgery. 
 
The post-mortem examination report stated that, in the opinion of the Consultant Histopathologist, Mr Spencer died due to a purulent peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity) secondary to a bowel perforation (rupture).  That was caused by a section of the small bowel getting stuck and becoming obstructed within a right inguinal hernia, increasing the pressure within the bowel.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
The GP medical history summary, populated by the GP that a patient is registered to, is not always accessible to a GP out of hours surgery.  Evidence was given that there are various reasons for this, including the patient not providing consent for the exchange of this information.  However, on some occasions, even when a patient has consented, the patient record systems utilised by the GP registered practice and the GP out of hours surgery, insofar as being different computer systems or for whatever other technological reason, prevented the exchange of information into the GP out of hours surgery.  In this case, evidence was heard that the GP practice was using the EMIS system and that the urgent treatment centre (GP out of hours surgery) was using SystmOne.  That fact caused the GP out of hours surgery to not be able to access Mr Spencer’s GP medical summary.  This situation generates a concern that, providing the patient has consented, key medical information may not be conveyed to the GP out of hours surgery which should be accessible to allow the appropriate exchange of medical information to inform what examinations should take place in an out of hours setting.  This concern is particularly significant in circumstances where the patient does not say and/or present with the points in the medical history relevant to the GPs determination about what further examinations should occur flowing from the medical history of the patient.","On 18 June 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of John Charles Spencer (“Mr Spencer”), aged 82 years.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 May 2025.  The conclusion of the inquest was Natural Causes.
 
Box 3 of the Record of Inquest read:
 
John Charles Spencer died on 21 May 2024.  Mr Spencer had become unwell on 17 May 2024, insofar as having diarrhoea and vomiting, after eating fish and chips.  On 20 May 2024, he had a telephone and a subsequent an in-person consultation with a GP out of hours surgery.  Mr Spencer’s past medical history included a right inguinal hernia repair in December 2010.  That information was not available on the computer system being used by the GP out of hours surgery and it was not mentioned by Mr Spencer in consultation.  The clinical diagnosis, consistent with his presentation, was gastroenteritis and safety net advice was given.  Mr Spencer was discharged and found deceased at his home address, [REDACTED], the next day.  There were no suspicious circumstances and there was no third party involvement.

Mr Foster suffered from epilepsy thereafter.
 
On 3rd September 2024 Mr Foster sustained prolonged seizure activity, he was taken to hospital by ambulance. Mr Foster was admitted to hospital and initially, was treated on the ITU.
 
On 14th September he had recovered sufficiently to be stepped down to ward-based care and through a series of medications sustained a five-week period without a seizure.
 
On 1st November 2024 Mr Foster removed a naso-gastric tube used for feeding and the administration of clobazam – an anti-convulsant. The reinsertion of the naso-gastric tube was delayed for eleven hours. During this period no thought was given to administering clobazam in a different manner.  A total interruption in the administration of clobazam lasted for for 13 hours. The same day Mr Foster suffered a resumption of seizure activity, he was later diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia which ultimately led to his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
A failure in governance at the Trust meant that this case was not identified as an  incident worthy of investigation through the Patient Safety Framework. This omission gives rise to a concern that future deaths may follow due to an inability on the part of the trust to identify, reflect upon, and remediate sub-optimal practice.
 
In this case the trust’s Datix incident reporting system, morbidity and mortality meeting process and PSIRF procedure were inadequate.","On 27th December 2024, this court commenced an investigation into the death of Kenneth Foster, aged 79 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9th May 2025. The court returned a narrative conclusion.
 
  “Kenneth Martin Robert Foster died in hospital on 25th November 2024 due to pneumonia caused by the aspiration of stomach content during a seizure. Mr Foster suffered from epilepsy caused by a traumatic brain injury sustained in 2012. Mr Foster was admitted to hospital on 3rd September 2024 due to seizures. Mr Fosters seizure activity was managed through a number of anti-convulsant medications, seizure activity was not observed for 5 weeks. On 11th November 2024 Mr Foster removed a naso-gastric tube used for feeding and the administration of clobazam an anti-convulsant. The removal of the tube led to an interruption in the administration of clobazam for 13 hours. The same day Mr Foster suffered a resumption of seizure activity, he was later diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia which ultimately led to his death.”
 
Mr Foster’s medical cause of death was determined as;
 
1a Aspiration pneumonia
1b Status Epilepticus
1c Complex partial seizures

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
1. The inquest heard evidence that the prolonged hospital stay and lack of progress in finding a suitable place in the community significantly contributed to her decline.
She had been suitable for discharge from 20th May and there was no clear strategy to progress her discharge or for the two different trusts to work together to ensure a speedy and safe discharge.
The evidence before the inquest indicated a lack of joined up working between the two trusts that meant that despite the clinical concerns about the impact of her prolonged hospital stay she remained in an acute setting
 
2. The GMMH documentation was of a poor quality and did not capture key discussions/decisions including in relation to medication. As a consequence, trust staff were not fully sighted on earlier decisions and her needs.
 
3. The lack of progress in discharge meant that an acute hospital bed was not available to other patients who needed care in an acute setting.",On 5TH November2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Janet Alison Anderson.

On 13th October 2024 Jake collapsed while playing football and had a short period of unconsciousness. He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital by his father. A full history was given that was consistent with an exercise induced syncope. An ECG was carried out. That was abnormal and showed a T wave inversion on lead V5. The clinicians noted there was the T wave inversion but did not recognise that this was a concerning finding from the ECG. The history given by his father was not assessed correctly. The T wave inversion particularly in combination with his collapse should have resulted in him being referred for an inpatient paediatric review and further testing. It is probable that he would not have died on the day he did had the correct actions been taken. Jake’s collapse was incorrectly attributed to his exercise induced asthma. He was referred back to the GP for review. He was reviewed by a GP by telephone on 14th October and face to face on 18th October 2024. A FeNO test referral to the asthma nurse was made. On 31st October 2024 the FeNO test was conducted. The asthma nurse referred Jake back to the doctor indicating they did not believe Jake had asthma. There was a plan to refer him to paediatrics. It was clear that the diagnosis of exercise induced asthma being the cause of his collapse on the 13th October 2024 was unlikely and that the working diagnosis within the discharge summary was probably incorrect. The significance of that was impacted by the discharge summary incorrectly describing the ECG as normal. On 5th November 2024 whilst playing football Jake collapsed. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he died at Wythenshawe Hospital on 5th November 2024.
The postmortem carried out found he had died as a consequence of having Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
1. The inquest heard evidence that the significance of 12 lead ECG readings are regularly missed or misunderstood by clinicians which means that key warning signs are missed as in Jake’s case. It is unclear if this is a training issue or the way in which the machines report or volume. Without an improvement there will be further avoidable deaths
 
2. Jake presented with a clear paediatric exercise induced syncope. The inquest was told that there is no clear national guidance on the pathway to be followed in relation to such children although medical training emphasised that this should be treated as a red flag event.
 
3. The diagnosis of exercise induced asthma appeared to be based on a history given at the early stages of his breathlessness being reported to the GP and was not revisited even when he was reporting that the classic treatments were not having a significant impact on his symptoms. This was compounded by the exercise induced syncope being incorrectly linked to asthma.
In addition, Jake was assessed by his GP practice using the national asthma scoring system. However, the scoring system does not appear to facilitate scoring for exercise induced asthma. In Jake’s case the readings and answers pointed to a well-controlled asthma. This was at variance with the fact that his history indicated that he was continuing to struggle with his breathing when exercising and meant he did not trigger as a concern. This was exacerbated by the normal peak flow readings taken at rest which gave a falsely reassuring picture. A lack of curiosity, a lack of appreciation of the limitations of the national scoring system and a non-holistic approach meant that he continued to be seen as asthmatic when all his symptoms were as a result of his undiagnosed Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
 
4. ECGs to rule out a possible cardiac issue cannot easily be given to children in a community setting.","On 8th November 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jake Samuel Lawler. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15th April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was narrative: Died from a biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy when he was incorrectly diagnosed in life with exercise induced asthma and the significance of a witnessed exercise induced syncope episode, and an abnormal ECG were not recognised or actioned appropriately. The medical cause of death was 1a) Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4th July 2025.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
The UK population is of increasing age and the number of older drivers is increasing rapidly. The current system for vehicle licensing relies largely upon the self-awareness of a driver and their willingness and\or ability to self-report medical conditions to the DVLA.   I am concerned that older drivers with vulnerabilities, including age, decreasing mobility and cognitive decline pose a risk of future deaths through compromised driving ability thereby creating a risk of deaths in the future.","On 4 November 2024 an inquest was opened into the death of Rosemary MacAndrew, aged 64. The inquest concluded on 28 April 2025. I made a determination at inquest that she died as a result of a road traffic collision.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 01 July 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

I have raised concerns in that respect separately. The surgeon in question is no longer conducting major surgery at your trust or in the local private sector. I am not aware of any current GMC restriction on his clinical practice.
 
With the permission of both families, I referred to two previous inquests  – Mr MR (date of death 4th March 2024), and Mr ME (date of death 28th December 2023). I did this not to re-open the facts of the two earlier inquests, but to focus on the trust’s death investigation processes, and how efficient they have been in terms of picking up issues following each of these deaths.
 
I instructed independent colorectal surgery experts to comment on the management, using two different experts for the three cases. It is fair to say that both experts were critical of the surgeon’s management. In looking at the trust’s death investigation processes, I made the following findings:
 
In the case of Mr ME, a significant surgical error was made when a healthy part of the bowel was removed instead of the area with the cancer, resulting in a much more extensive operation and Mr ME dying around 5 weeks later. This was discussed in a morbidity and mortality meeting, which ends with the simple phrase “await coroner’s report”. A structured judgment review was carried out by a consultant colorectal colleague on 4th of May 2024, over four months after the death. According to this review, all of the care given to Mr ME was either “good” or “excellent”.
 
A further structured judgement review took place. It would appear that none of the colorectal surgeons was willing to carry this out, resulting in the need for a gastroenterologist to conduct a second review in July 2024, by which time the surgeon had already been suspended from major operative work.
 
It is important to note that in a clinical governance meeting in February 2024 (ie before either of these structured judgement reviews) it was noted that there were “no learning points identified” in relation to Mr ME’s case.
 
In the case of Mr MR, a structured judgement review took place conducted by a consultant surgical colleague. This report was frankly so poor that I wrote to the Chief Medical Officer about it after the inquest. It has the look of the briefest of reviews and tick box exercises. Again, all of the management is referred to as “good”.
 
Mr MR’s case was not discussed during the March 2024 morbidity and mortality meeting, despite the fact that a later death (Lorraine Parker’s, on 30th March 2024) was discussed then. Mr MR’s case did not go to a morbidity and mortality meeting discussion until May 2024. The reasons for this remain unclear.
 
In Lorraine’s case, there was a morbidity and mortality meeting discussion in March 2024 (or perhaps shortly thereafter). The April clinical governance meeting minutes refer to Lorraine’s case and again state “no learning points”.
 
None of these three cases has been the subject of a detailed PSIRF report.
 
I have set out my concerns about the Trust’s death investigation processes in more detail below. It is important to mention that I have found it far too difficult to extract the relevant documents from the trust in each of these cases. To expand on this:
 
  – During Lorraine’s inquest, I received for the first time, a death investigation document relevant to Mr MR’s case (an inquest I conducted in October 2024).
 – This difficulty extends routinely to obtaining medical records from this trust. This is not an issue which is shared with other trusts we work with within Berkshire.
 – RBH now has electronic records, and it is difficult for me to understand how it is that so many inquests I have conducted recently have had incomplete records. Provision of records found at short notice is rapidly becoming the norm. This is unhelpful to me and it is unhelpful to the bereaved families we deal with. It also means that death investigation processes are hampered and risk being incomplete.
 – This approach appears to apply to the clinical governance documents I have requested in each of these cases as well. I cannot be sure in any case whether I have received all of the relevant documents or not. I have not formed the view that this is due to a lack of candour, but whatever the reason, it is surprisingly inefficient for a trust of this size.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.  In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. On the evidence I have seen from the three inquests referred to, the Royal Berkshire Hospital’s death investigation process is not working well.","The family requested me to refer to the deceased as Lorraine. I will reflect that in this report. I conducted an inquest into the death of Lorraine Sandra Parker which concluded on 3rd April 2025. She was 52, and died on 30th March 2024. I recorded a narrative conclusion as follows: 
 
Natural causes, contributed to by cancer, by necessary surgical treatment, and by delay in diagnosing and managing anastomotic leak, after surgery conducted on 23rd of January 2024.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report,

It is important to note the case of R (Dr Siddiqui and Dr Paeprer-Rohricht) v Assistant Coroner for East London. This case clarifies that the issuing and receipt of a Regulation 28 report entails no more than the coroner bringing some information regarding a public safety concern to the attention of the recipient. The report is not punitive in nature and engages no civil or criminal right or obligation on the part of the recipient, other than the obligation to respond to the report in writing within 56 days.",['https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-0194-Response-from-Royal-Berkshire-NHS-Foundation-Trust-.pdf']

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are, as follows:
 
The healthcare assistant who had been with Mrs Dixon on the evening of 6 October 2024, clearly referred in her statement to the patient having been fed. Shortly thereafter the healthcare assistant heard “a noise” coming from the patient’s chest and so she called for the assistance of a nearby nurse. Two nurses attended and made the reasonable assumption that the patient was choking. Treatment was administered and a set of vital observations showed that the patient’s oxygen saturations were 87%. On this basis, nursing staff called for an emergency ambulance: the London Ambulance Service (LAS) call handler was told that the patient was “choking” albeit she was breathing and conscious at that time.
 
Despite this, once LAS staff arrived at Acorn Lodge Care Home, the Care Home staff told paramedics that they had been attempting to feed the patient, but the patient started to gasp before any food was given to her, meaning they were unable to feed her.
 
This raises concerns about the communication and integrity of the staff members at the Care Home in their provision of care to the patient. I did not receive any reassurance that this concern has been addressed.
 
While the patient was breathing and conscious at the time of the 999 call, when LAS staff attended six minutes later, the patient was not conscious, not breathing, had no palpable pulse, and was critically unwell in confirmed cardiac arrest. However, despite this, staff from the Care Home were not undertaking CPR. The DNACPR would not have applied in this case, because choking is a potentially reversible cause of cardiac arrest, which the Care Home’s manager confirmed in her evidence.
 
This raises the concern that staff (healthcare assistants and nursing staff) at the Care Home may have previously unidentified training needs and/or lacked the clinical skills/knowledge to provide emergency care.","On 11 October 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Ivy May DIXON, aged 96 years at the time of her death.
 
The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard by me on 28 January and 28 March 2025.
 
I conclusion of the inquest was a short narrative conclusion.

He moved to Hyde Nursing Home on 4th January 2024 as he needed full time care due to his needs. Unknown to his family Hyde Nursing Home was subject to a quality improvement action plan. It is probable his family would not have chosen the home had they known about the concerns of the quality improvement team. A multiagency meeting in December did not fully consider the risks presented by the audit of the home.
As a consequence, the home was permitted to continue to accept new residents. It is probable that if the position had been fully discussed at the December meeting, the home would not have been permitted to accept new residents. Bernard Lyon would probably not have been resident. Whilst resident at Hyde Nursing Home, Bernard Lyon’s modified diet care plan was not always adhered to by staff. This was due to a shortage of managers and communication issues between the management team and staff.
On 22nd January he attended Tameside General Hospital. He was found to be very unwell with sepsis. There was a delay in giving antibiotics as a consequence of the volume of patients in the Emergency Department at the time. He was treated for aspiration pneumonia. He deteriorated despite active treatment and was placed on end of life care. On 30th January 2024 he died at Tameside General Hospital.

Mr McDonald had a history of mental ill-health and had been formally detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 since 14 November 2020. Mr McDonald was admitted to the Fitzmary 2 Ward of the NPU at Bethlem Royal Hospital on 7 July 2022.  His diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that staff working on the NPU did not have knowledge or a clear understanding of the “AWOL – Missing & Absent Persons Policy” of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (“SLAM”) Specifically:
 
(1) Whilst there should be an individualised assessment of whether it is appropriate to suspend section 17 when a patient goes AWOL: (a) one member of staff at the inquest gave evidence that it was “standard practice” and “protocol” that leave would be suspended; and (b) there was no evidence of any individualised assessment in Mr McDonald’s case. 
 
(2) The policy provides that SLAM staff should always accompany the police if the patient is to be returned from their home. This was not done in this case, and there was no evidence that any member of NPU staff considered this once Mr McDonald was located at his mother’s address on 24 February 2023.
 
(3) The policy provides that if the police are likely to be involved in returning the patient to hospital then an action plan – jointly drafted between the police and Trust staff – needs to be drawn up. This was not done in this case, and there was no evidence that this was considered or completed by SLAM staff.","On 21 March 2023, an inquest was opened, and an investigation commenced, into the death of Christopher McDonald, who was aged 41 at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, which was heard over 7-days between 17 and 25 March 2025, with a jury. The inquest engaged the enhanced investigative obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
 
The medical cause of death was:
1a Ligature strangulation; and
2   Schizoaffective disorder.
 
The conclusion of the jury as to the death was that Mr McDonald died by strangulation by a ligature that he applied around his neck, but the evidence did not enable them to say what his intentions were. 
 
The following matters were recorded in the narrative conclusion:
 
(1) There were shortcomings in the decision-making in relation to the suspension of Mr McDonald’s section 17 leave on 24 February 2023, which possibly contributed to his death.  The shortcomings were a lack of an individualised assessment and a failure to follow the “AWOL – Missing and Absent Persons Policy”. Had a member of the National Psychosis Unit (“NPU”) accompanied Mr McDonald back to the ward on 25 February 2025, it is possible that this may have mitigated any potential distress.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2 June 2025.

Prior to his death, a relationship had ended and he had financial concerns.
 
On the 31st March 2024, Mr Masheter telephoned his friend and ask for help as he was “dying”. His friend telephoned 999 and requested an ambulance. The request was triage as a category 3 incident. There were 3 further calls to the ambulance service on the evening of the 31st March 2024. All resulted under the triage systems as a category 3. There were also significant delays in resource availability on this night.
 
In the final 999 call, Mr Masheter’s friend was told there were delays of one and a half hours and his original call was one hour ten minutes ago. Believing the ambulance to be due imminently, the friend left. The ambulance did not arrive until 08:10am on the 1st April 2024 and the crew found Mr Masheter deceased by hanging.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The NHS Pathways system is used for triage. This asks standard questions to ascertain the seriousness of the situation including whether the patient is awake and breathing and so on. The triage pathway includes some options for mental health situations but these are limited. Evidence was heard in the inquest that the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) had liaised with NHS Pathways with a view to exploring how mental health calls are triaged. NHS Pathways declined to make any changes to mental health triage but offered advice to NWAS in how to triage mental health situations.
The evidence heard at the inquest was that notwithstanding the seriousness of the situation in which Mr Masheter presented, his appropriate categorisation was category 3. This led to significant delays in an ambulance attending. It is not clear to me whether it is possible for serious mental health crisis situations which present a risk to life are capable of being properly risk assessed on the basis of the NHS Pathways mental health triage which exists at present.","On the 3rd April 2024 the Coroner’s Office was notified of the death of James Paul Michael Masheter and an investigation commenced into his death. An inquest was opened and adjourned on the 11th April 2024 and a final inquest took place on the 13th of February 2025 with conclusions delivered on the 25th February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
 
“James Paul Michael MASHETER died on the 1st April 2024 at his home address by hanging. Mr MASHETER had struggled with his mental health and had previously engaged in self-injurious behaviours. On the 31st March 2024, Mr MASHETER made a number of cuts to himself with a knife and telephoned friends telling them he was dying and asking for help. Mr MASHETER’s friends called for an ambulance and one friend attended his home address. Mr MASHETER was distressed and bleeding from superficial wounds. Due to demands of the service, there were significant delays in ambulance allocation but Mr MASHETER’s friend was told that that delay was significantly less than was the case. Believing an ambulance to be arriving imminently, the friend left Mr MASHETER, who went on to secure a ligature which caused his death. Incorrect information about the waiting times for ambulance attendance was provided to Mr MASHETER’s friend and this contributed to his death. It is not possible to determine Mr MASHETER’s intentions at the time at which he secured the ligature given his behaviour was in the context of a significant mental health crisis”.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 30th May 2025.

Section 2 of the Record of Inquest (which recorded the medical cause of Mary Pomeroy’s death) was determined as:
 
1a – combined physiological effects of bilateral humeral fractures in an elderly patient
1b – traumatic fall to ground following being pushed over
 
Section 3 of the Record of Inquest (which answered how, when and where Mary Pomeroy came by her death) was determined as:
 
‘Mary Pomeroy was an in-patient at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth when, on 3 March 2022, she was pushed over on to the floor by a fellow patient who had been suffering with psychotic symptoms and cognitive and behavioural problems.  Mary suffered fractures as a result of this trauma.  Mary’s condition deteriorated after, and as a direct result of, this incident, and she died on 15 March 2022 at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth.  There was a lack of assessment and management of the patient who pushed Mary over and this materially contributed to the incident occurring and therefore to Mary’s death.’
 
Section 4 of the Record of Inquest (which provided the conclusion as to Mary Pomeroy’s death) was determined, in narrative form, as:
 
‘Mary Pomeroy died from injuries suffered following being pushed over by a fellow patient on the same ward in hospital – this fellow patient had psychiatric, behavioural and cognitive difficulties and wasn’t being closely supervised on the ward.’","During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Derriford Hospital in Plymouth is the main acute hospital site managed by UHP NHS.  UHP NHS carried out a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) investigation in respect of the circumstances which led to Mary Pomeroy being pushed to the ground by a fellow patient on a ward at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth and her death thereafter.  This investigation culminated in a written investigation report which was given executive sign off on 14 July 2022, by the SI panel chair and chief nurse of UHP NHS.
 
The main body of the investigation report concluded that the incident which led to Mary Pomeroy being pushed to the ground by a fellow patient was ‘a rare and devastating accident for which could not have been foreseen’.
 
The summary of the SI Panel Meeting Review, chaired by the Chief Nurse on 4 July 2022, stated that ‘overall it was considered that [the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy] was managed appropriately during his admission to UHP NHS and concluded that this was a deeply unfortunate accident, but not one that could have been anticipated and therefore prevented by staff.’
 
The inquest heard evidence that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy to the ground on 3 March 2022 had done almost exactly the same thing to another patient on the ward only two days previously, on 1 March 2022 – this incident was discussed in the main body of the RCA investigation report, but not referred to at all in the SI Panel Meeting Review summary.  The inquest also heard evidence that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy had been involved in a number of incidents where he had used physical force on staff members on the ward in February 2022.
 
At the inquest, the author of UHP NHS’s investigation report (who was the Matron of the relevant ward) accepted, in evidence, that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy should, on 3 March 2022, have been subject to enhanced observations of care – this was on the basis that previous assessments in November 2021 and January 2022 had shown that this was required for him owing to his psychiatric and behavioural presentation (which had become more concerning by the end of February/beginning of March 2022) and also because of very recent and specific concerns regarding his behaviour which should have been obvious to ward staff following the incident on 1 March 2022. 
 
The Matron accepted, in evidence, that had enhanced observation and care been in place for the patient (which could have taken a number of forms following assessment, depending on what would have been most clinically and therapeutically appropriate at the time) then he should have been prevented from being in a position where he was able to push Mary Pomeroy to the ground on 3 March 2022.
 
The Matron accepted, in evidence, that UHP NHS’s RCA report had been incorrect to conclude that the type of incident that occurred on 3 March 2022 could not have been foreseen.  The Deputy Chief Nurse of UHP NHS accepted, in evidence, that the SI Panel Meeting should have interrogated the relevant facts and chronology more.
 
The inquest determined that the incident on the ward on 3 March 2022 was foreseeable, based on the concerns about the patient’s behaviour, the likely triggers for him becoming distressed and aggressive and the almost identical incident that had occurred on 1 March 2022.  The inquest also determined that the lack of assessment and management of this patient’s behaviour and needs materially contributed to the incident which led to Mary Pomeroy suffering injuries and led to her death.
 
It is unfortunately clear, when comparing the evidence heard at the inquest with the findings of UHP NHS’s RCA report, that there was inadequate analysis of this serious incident by UHP NHS, with concerning circumstances surrounding the care provided not being identified – therefore appropriate recommendations to inform future care provision were not given consideration as part of the RCA investigation/report. 
 
If UHP NHS do not identify concerning matters when carrying out internal investigations and do not take steps to try and learn from serious incidents when they occur, then there is an obvious, significant and continuing risk of future deaths occurring arising out of healthcare provision provided.","On 25 March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Mary Margaret Pomeroy. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest hearing on 25 March 2025 at Exeter Coroner’s Court, in the County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay Coroner Area.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action (for the reasons set out in paragraph 5, above).","Your organisation is under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27 May 2025.

Mr Konitzer died when removing props behind a recently excavated retaining wall which collapsed onto him.
 
As a result of senior management failures to manage the project in a manner so as to preserve the safety of those involved in the execution of the works the trust was prosecuted and pleaded guilty. There appeared to be lack of understanding by the trust of the legal obligations set by the Construction Design Management Regulations and little appreciation of relevant standards and guidance such as are to be found by reference to British Standards and HSE Guidance.

Tom had been transferred from the Ipswich Hospital to the Broomfield Hospital on the 16th April 2024, following the delayed presentation of a strangulated hiatus hernia with an ischaemic stomach.
 
Tom underwent a number of emergency surgeries at the Broomfield Hospital, which were ultimately unsuccessful. Tom developed multi-organ failure, and was commenced on end-of-life care until his death on the 22nd May 2024.
 
On the 13th April 2024 Tom had attended the Ipswich Hospital with vomiting symptoms indicative of a gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Tom was admitted onto an assessment unit for observations overnight.
 
On the 14th April 2024 Tom was reviewed by a Doctor at around 11:00, and was deemed to be clinically well enough for discharge.   Tom was discharged at around 17:00 on the 14th April 2024.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you;
 
the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows.  –
 
At inquest it was heard in evidence Tom was suffering from a hiatus hernia, which is a common condition suffered by up to 60% of the population in middle and later life. In the majority of cases a hiatus hernia is asymptomatic, and an individual can be unaware of its presence.
 
Evidence identified there are two types of hiatus hernia.
 
A sliding hiatus hernia, which moves up and down through the naturally occurring hole in the diaphragm, and therefore in and out of the chest area, and;
 
A para-oesophageal hiatus hernia (also called a rolling hiatus hernia) where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus and stays there.
 
In the population over 80% of those individuals who suffer from this condition have a sliding hiatus hernia, whilst only between 5-15% will have a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia.
 
The difference between the two types of hiatus hernia is import, as the para-oesophageal hiatus hernia is far more likely to develop known complications, and therefore more likely to require surgery.
 
However, it was heard in evidence that in England many non-gastro specialist medical clinicians within the NHS are unaware of the difference in the two types of hiatus hernia, and are therefore unaware of the additional risk posed to the 5-15% of patients with a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia.
 
It was heard in evidence that the NHS England online guidance makes no distinction between the two types of hiatus hernias, whereas the guidance for NHS Scotland does.
 
As a result, the lack of understanding of the difference between the two types of hiatus hernia within the medical community means that there is no increased vigilance taken when individuals with a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia present with symptoms.
 
In addition, the cohort of individuals who suffer from para-oesophageal hiatus hernia in England, are unaware of the increased risk posed by their condition and are therefore unable to advocate for more testing, or seek a second opinion, when worrying symptoms do arise.","On 5th June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of
 
Thomas Alexander GLOVER
 
The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10th March 2025.
 
The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:-
 
Naturally occurring strangulation of a hiatus hernia with delayed surgical intervention resulting from an earlier missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis.
 
The medical cause of death was confirmed as:
 
1a Multi-organ Failure
1b Strangulated Hiatus Hernia and Ischaemic Stomach","In my opinion action should be taken in order to prevent future deaths, and I believe you or your organisation have the power to take any such action you identify.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 12th May 2025 I, the Senior Coroner, may extend the period if I consider it reasonable to do so.

In September 2021 Benjamin started to suffer a deterioration in his physical and mental wellbeing; according to the evidence this was probably due to an episode of swallowing water in a swimming pool; that event started a pathway of decline over several months.  The evidence at the inquest supports the conclusion that the cause was multifactorial and there are a number of possible contributory factors to the deterioration in his health and the escalation in his disruptive behaviour, these included:
–         Aspects of his physical health
–         His medications
–         The removal from his GP Practice
–          Placement on the Special Allocation Scheme
–         The lack of an effective medication review and 
–         Changes in his routines
 
Benjamin required multidisciplinary input into all aspects of his care planning; including primary care for prescribing medication for emotional wellbeing and pain, from psychology for safe interventions, specialist sensory occupational therapy for communication and interaction with the world.
 
In January 2022 when Benjamin was in crisis, clinical support and advice was limited – he was not able to see a GP, he did not receive a full and effective medication review and in the early part of January 2022 he was not in receipt of a full and effective social care package.
 
The inquest heard evidence about the Devon Adult Autism Intervention Team (commissioned by The Devon Integrated Care Board and operated by Devon Partnership Trust).  This team  forms part of the Devon Health and Social Care Systems response to the needs of autistic adults across Devon, although it was not fully operational when Benjamin died. The team offers signposting and advice, consultation for professionals and assessment, formulation and provision of direct interventions where needed. This is a clinical team consisting of Psychology, Speech & Language, Occupational Therapy and Psychiatry.  However the team is only able to offer limited interventions and not in circumstances where the individual is in crisis.
 
In the early hours of the 1 February 2022, at a time when he was distressed and overwhelmed by his emotions and difficulties tolerating change, Benjamin left his accommodation where he was being supported by carers and walked barefoot and in his night clothes to the M5 where he was hit by a lorry.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The evidence reveals that there was a gap in the provision of care for individuals suffering with autism and in crisis, that remains the case today both in Devon and nationally.  Evidence was heard that a gap exists with autistic people in distress and or dysregulation with no treatable mental health condition and there is a grey area around treatment.  This is beyond the skills of social care providers. And unless the individual meets the criteria for treatment under the Mental Health Act there is very little support.
 
Benjamin was removed from his GP practice due to violent behaviour and allocated to the Special Allocation Scheme.  This scheme was not able to meet the needs of a patient such as Benjamin with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum disorder.","On  10 February 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Benjamin Robert Compton. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 4 -5 March and 10 March 2025.  The conclusion of the inquest was as follows:
 
On 1 February 2022 Benjamin Robert Compton died after being hit by a lorry on the M5, Devon, between junctions 29 and 28.   
 
Road Traffic Collision","Consideration should be given to reviewing the process of supporting and providing interventions to those individuals suffering with autism and in crisis.
 
 Consideration should be given to ensuring that when  patients are allocated to the GP Special Allocation Scheme they are properly assessed as being suitable for the scheme and receive the appropriate clinical care and treatment.

He had long-term drug abuse issues including purchasing drugs online.
 
At the time of his death Mr Barnes was subject to probation service supervision following a short period on licence and a 12 month community order made by Guildford Crown Court, this included a Drug Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR). The DRR was not implemented by the probation service. Mr Barnes was referred to a similar programme, which he attended, but which could not require him to undergo regular drug testing. The coroner heard that any such alteration to sentence requires the court itself to review the original sentence. That did not happen in Mr Barnes’ case.
 
Following his arrest in April 2023  Mr Barnes had been referred by Westminster Court Probation Service to the Liaison and Diversion Service at Westminster Magistrates Court for assessment and review. A report was prepared by a specialist practitioner for intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities. That report included insights into his character and behaviour, discussion about his autism and recommendations as to how best to manage Mr Barnes in the future. In June 2023 post sentence probation supervision for Mr Barnes was passed from London to Staines.

On 14th November he was remanded in custody pending being put before a court on 15th November. 
 
During the afternoon of 14th November, Nicholas was provided with a hot drink and a snack bar in his cell. AT 1507 hours he was observed by his in-cell CCTV (which was not regularly monitored) to pull his blanket over his head and shortly thereafter to become motionless. A Detention Officer looked through the observation panel in Nicholas’ cell door at 1522 hours and observed him to be breathing.
 
At 1544 hours, Nicholas was found to be unresponsive by another Detention Officer who had entered his cell as part of a final check before handing over to the late shift. Another Detention Officer and a Healthcare Professional (a nurse) attended the cell. Nicholas was moved from the cell bench to the floor, and the nurse inserted an intraosseous needle at 1548 hours and an oxygen mask shortly thereafter. The nurse continued to attempt to rouse Nicholas and applied defibrillator pads to him at 1551 hours. CPR was commenced at 1552 hours. Ambulance staff arrived at 1556 hours and Nicholas was taken from the cell to hospital at 1626 hours. He was pronounced deceased in the Ressus area of the Emergency Department at Leeds General Infirmary at 1656 hours. His heart had remained in asystole or pulseless electrical activity from the point of his being discovered unresponsive in his cell.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
 
From the point when the Detention Officer first entered Nicholas’ cell to when CPR was commenced, 8 minutes and 12 seconds elapsed without CPR being given. Within that timeframe, two Detention Officers and a nurse were present in the cell after 75 seconds had passed.
 
On the evidence, there did not appear to be any shared understanding between the three people in the cell with Nicholas of the urgency of starting CPR on an unresponsive person. There did not appear to be a co-ordinated approach to assisting Nicholas, with the Detention Officers and the nurse not appearing to have defined roles which they understood and undertook.
 
It was not clear whether there were any protocols in place to define the respective roles of detention staff and medical staff attending a medical emergency in a cell. The passage of time before CPR was commenced gives rise to a concern either that the importance of early CPR was not appreciated, or that the communication between detention and medical staff did not facilitate its prompt commencement.","On 22nd November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nicholas Oliver James Gedge (“Nicholas”) The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 07/03/2025.

clopidogrel an antiplatelet medication to reduce the risk of clots. She required help with activities of daily living but remained mobile and would walk around the care home often at a fast pace. She  was assessed as at high risk of falls and had several falls due to her constant walking. At 23.05 on  07/04/23 she fell forwards in the hallway causing an injury to her forehead and back. She was  assessed and not thought to have any significant injury. 111 was called who advised further  monitoring. The following day she presented as normal however from 09/04/23 her condition  changed, and she appeared more sleepy and her mobility declined meaning she required more  assistance. On 12/04/23 she was assessed by a GP as part of the weekly ward round who noted  the fall and an injury to her right eye which was now very bruised but found no abnormalities or  changes so advised further monitoring. On 13/04/23 she was noted to be struggling to walk and  required a wheelchair and her mobility continued to deteriorate. After concerns were raised by her  husband, she was reviewed again on 17/04/23 by a GP. The GP was not advised of any  deterioration in her presentation and found no abnormal neurological signs but suspected she may have suffered a concussion from the fall. The plan was for her to be seen on the next weekly ward  round, and she was given eye drops for an eye infection. She was not added to the list for the  weekly ward round on 19/04/23. Mrs Phillips continued to deteriorate and require assistance and 
on 22/04/23 she was noted to be very sleepy. By 24/04/23 she was noted to be very unwell and  struggling to walk and eat and drink independently and after review by a GP she was admitted to  Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where a CT scan confirmed a large right sided traumatic subdural haemorrhage which was treated conservatively until her death on 30/04/23. It is likely she suffered  a head injury when she fell on 07/04/23 and that clopidogrel caused the initial injury to worsen over time but it is not possible to say whether earlier admission to hospital would have impacted on the  outcome.",,,,,,['https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-0112-Response-from-Willow-Grange-Care-Home.pdf']

On 23/6/24 a member of staff found Mr Jones in his room with denture adhesive gel in his mouth, ears and nose. Attempts were made to remove the substance from his mouth. Mr Jones’ breathing became laboured and paramedics attended and took him to hospital where his health deteriorated and he died on 23/6/24.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
 
 
1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:
 
(i) Mr Jones lived in a self contained unit at the care home where he had his own room and en suite facilities.
 
(ii) Upon his arrival risk assessments were carried out including choking hazards and a full Care Plan created which included oral care.
 
(iii) Although Mr Jones was living with dementia he was able to care for himself except for being prompted and with the support from one care staff with his personal care.
 
(iv) He had capacity to make daily non-complex decisions. He wished to maintain his independence as far as possible with all aspects of his daily care needs. He was able to manage elements of his own daily personal care which included oral care.
 
(v) Mr Jones had upper and lower dentures which he secured in place on a daily basis using an adhesive gel. He had daily access to this gel which was stored in his bathroom cabinet. There were no reported concerns regarding his daily access to the adhesive gel. The gel and other toiletries were provided by his family.
 
(vi) When paramedics attended on 23/6/24 they attempted to remove the gel with a suction machine but were unsuccessful.
 
(vii) At autopsy there was evidence of upper airway obstruction by thick adhesive gel. This thick adhesive gel was seen inside the mouth and pharynx and had completely blocked the larynx and trachea and extended into the left bronchus
 
 (viii) The packaging of the gel was examined and there was no warning on either the box or the enclosed leaflet that gave a warning that the gel was a potential choking hazard.
 
 
2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:
 
(i) Mr Leatham-Prosser had started taking Cannabis as a young teenager and at the age of 17 progressed on to taking ketamine. He did not perceive this to be any more harmful than cannabis.
 
(ii) The evidence before the inquest was that ketamine was a highly addictive drug.
 
(iii) Ketamine cystitis is an emerging epidemic in the younger population with access to this drug seemingly easy to acquire. The extremely harmful effect of this drug on the bladder is akin to acid attacks on the skin.
 
(iv) Patients seen by urologists are abusing the drug to the extent required to damage the urinary tract to the point of requiring major reconstructive surgery. The only way patients know how to relieve their symptoms is with ongoing ketamine use. A vicious cycle develops worsening the urological condition and reinforces dependence on the drug with high rates of relapse.
 
2. I have concerns with regard to the following:
 
(i) The highly addictive and harmful nature of a drug with a classification of Class B.
 
(ii) The increasing number of young people presenting with potentially fatal health problems linked to its use.","On the 13th June 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Joshua William Leatham-Prosser, born on the 5th March 1998.

He was brought to Princess Royal University Hospital A&E department at 20.40 on 1st January 2020, after an overdose of Paracetamol, having been persuaded by his family and emergency services personnel. He was at high risk of suicide and required continuous 1:1 observations, but never had them. There were poor communications between MH staff and A&E staff, exacerbated by separate medical recording.
He deceitfully absconded four times whilst in the department, twice purchasing and drinking more alcohol. Security staff were not alerted to his risks. He did not have repeated risk or capacity assessments, nor have a Mental Health Act assessment, despite his circumstances and mental state deteriorating. After removing his IV line, he finally absconded for the final time, which could have been prevented.","Many of the failings have been addressed locally. But during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN addressed to Oxleas and CQC are as follows.  –
 
1. Individual mental health professionals appeared to have gaps in knowledge and judgment. The director who was spokesperson for the Mental Health Trust did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of these deficits.
 
 a) A mental health liaison nurse, who now is manager of these nurses, did not recognize the patient as high risk, despite his having been persuaded to attend A&E by the police against his will, having just expressed suicidal ideation, made a previous attempt, with alcohol intoxication and absconsion, as at the time he denied suicidality. Even in retrospect in court she did not acknowledge her misjudgement. She also asserted incorrectly that a patient who has mental capacity cannot be assessed under the Mental Health Act.","On 15th January 2020 an inquest was opened into the death of Mr Paul Timothy Dunne, aged 45, on 02.01.20.

He was assessed on the day before discharge as having “less capacity to make informed decisions about his follow up” and he refused the Home Treatment Team’s input post discharge. His mother considered he was not ready for discharge; the residential support service wanted him to remain under mental health (MH) section on section 17 leave, as it enabled much easier recall to hospital.

Mr Collingridge was travelling on the Colchester bound single carriageway navigating a bend when there was queuing traffic and was struck by an oncoming vehicle that had no opportunity to take avoiding action on the B1027 Colchester Road at junction with Frowick Lane, St Osyth. The roadworks for utility repairs had been put in place overnight and the required permit was not in place.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Where Road Works Permits are required by utility companies these are often urgent to carry out vital repairs. This can mean that roadworks are set up in hours of darkness and may cause difficulties calculating distances as set out in the Safety at Street Works Code of Practice.
 
The Safety of Street Works Code of Practice sets out how to take measurements to set out street works that include utlising street furniture that are at set distances and standard road markings that have standard lengths on carriageways with specific road speeds.
 
Some carriageways do not have street furniture
Some of the road markings on the carriage where the fatal collision did not comply to standard lengths  and therefore the markings can have variations.
The Code of Practice does not set out how to calculate the distance where there is road curvature where the road markings have differing lengths on opposing sides where the markings are delineated on bends in a carriageway.
 
A road works warning sign was placed at the junction that joined the carriageway of a road that obscured visibility of traffic joining the main carriageway. Whilst this did not cause or contribute to this incident this was not in accordance with the Code of Practice.
 
The fatal incident that occurred on 6 December 2022 was not notified on the retrospective permit application for roadworks on the following day. There is no requirement for a fatality within roadworks be notified on application for an application for a permit .","On 12 December 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Paul Stephen COLLINGRIDGE, AGE 28.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Matters of Operational Concern
 
While the evidence called at inquest relates to HMP Lowdham Grange, these issues are likely to be relevant across the prison estate, and for that reason I highlight my concerns to both the Minister for Prisons and NHS England as commissioners for prison healthcare.
 
1. Recruitment, retention and training of prison and healthcare staff (response required by the Minister for Prisons and NHSE)
Staffing levels
I heard compelling evidence from prison and healthcare staff who told me they were overwhelmed, over-burdened and under-supported in their work at HMP Lowdham Grange.
 
I understand from both prison providers (Serco and Sodexo) and the Healthcare Trust (Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust), that recruitment and retention of staff was a persistent challenge, meaning more often than not the staff on shift were required to cover more than their fair workload. This led to low staff morale, higher levels of sickness absence, and an inevitable deterioration in prisoner safety.
 
The inadequate prison and healthcare staffing levels led to a restricted regime and healthcare provision. The prison was unable to offer keywork to all men, and the mental health team could no longer offer a named nurse service. Both of these aspects of care are fundamental to supporting the most vulnerable prisoners.
 
For months prior to the deaths, the Trust failed to fulfil its commissioned obligations to provide a nurse during night state. Prison staff have only basic first aid training and lacked the expertise of a medical professional when attempting to provide CPR to Anthony.
 
Skill mix and experience
I am concerned by the failure to retain experienced prison officers and healthcare staff. The private prison operator and the Authority were focused on the number of staff, rather than the skills set or experience of the staffing body as a whole. One PCO told me that he was considered the most senior on shift in the houseblock with less than 2 years’ experience of working as a prison officer. The healthcare team had worked for a protracted period with no permanent Head of Service in post.
 
Without a sufficient number of experienced staff, the prison had lost organisational memory, allowing poor custom and practice to become the norm amongst inexperienced and overwhelmed staff.
 
Training
All of the prison staff had completed the ITC programme, and yet there was widespread evidence of failures to do the basics. Staff failed to ensure the welfare of prisoners at roll count, failed to challenge flagrant breaches of prison rules such as passing items under cell doors, and did not know how to properly deal with obscured cell observation hatches.
This calls into question the adequacy of their basic training, and the system for supervision and mentoring during the early years of practice.
 
Healthcare staff were often not included in the same training as prison staff, and where agency staff were used to fill vacancies, they were not part of Trust training. Again, this led to poor custom and practice such as failing to read medical records before reviewing the mental health and wellbeing of the prisoners.
 
Accepting there is a complex interplay between staffing numbers, experience and quality of training, I highlight to you my concern that continued understaffing of prison and healthcare teams will undoubtedly contribute to future deaths in custody.
 
2. A complete failure to identify and share risk pertinent information between prison and healthcare staff, and within those teams (response required from the Minister for Prisons, NHSE, Serco, Sodexo and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust)
The staff remaining at the prison in March 2023 were, by their own admission, firefighting what was in front of them, rather than working in a collaborative and holistic way to better serve prisoner safety.
 
There was a complete breakdown in the system of risk identification and information sharing. Prison and healthcare staff did not routinely consider information captured within the electronic systems, nor did they update the systems with risk pertinent information gathered during interactions with the prisoners.
 
The prison records (the core file and P-NOMIS) and healthcare records (systemone) are a valuable source of risk pertinent information, that will enable prison and healthcare staff to comply with the mandatory requirement of PSI 64/2011 “All staff who have contact with prisoners must be aware of the triggers that may increase the risk of suicide, self-harm or violence, and take appropriate action.”
 
Many prison and healthcare witnesses believed there was no working system in place at HMP Lowdham Grange to allow them to identify and share risk pertinent information. As a result, operational decisions were made in silo, and interactions with Anthony, David and Rolandas, were conducted without due consideration of their risk pertinent information.
 
This causes concern from both a training and policy perspective.
 
It would be impossible for prison and healthcare staff to remember the triggers for each and every prisoner in their care. Therefore, the system in place needs to make it as easy as possible for staff to quickly and readily understand the risk that exits for the prisoner and what might trigger that risk to materialise in any given circumstance. In this case, as in previous deaths, there was excessivefocus on the prisoner’s current presentation (i.e. the absence of saying they were going to harm themselves) without any understanding of their previous self-harm and suicidality.
 
Specific missed opportunities included:
 – a failure by prison and healthcare staff to read the incoming prisoner’s core file. This hard copy file contains valuable information such as previous ACCT documents and SASH warning forms, yet instead of reviewing this material and pulling out key triggers for past self-harm and suicidality and recording the same on P-NOMIS and/or systemone, the files were sent straight to storage. This is despite the fact that a background history of deliberate self-harm is an evidence-based risk factor for suicide as set out in PSI 64/2011
 – Healthcare staff concluding on Friday 3 March 2023 that Anthony’s inability to attend a candle lighting service might be a trigger for self-harm, but such was not communicated to prison staff or safer custody or recorded on any prison systems
 – David’s PNOMIS file clearly indicated his fear of joining the general prison population led to him requiring VP status in his previous establishment. However, the officers who sought to move him from the induction wing had not read his notes nor were they aware of the content of his previous ACCTs.","On 5 April 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony Binfield, David William Richards and Rolandas Karbauskas.
 
The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, heard before a jury, calling evidence on dates between 4 November 2024 and 7 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Anthony, David and Rolandas had all died as a result of self-inflicted ligature asphyxiation, while in state detention at HMP Lowdham Grange, within a 19-day period of one another.
 
The jury found multiple failings and missed opportunities in their care had probably more than minimally contributed to their deaths.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take action in relation to the above matters.

(1) The absence of a formal, documented handover system between hospital and Neighbourhood Team and the fact that the NT cannot simply check hospital records of patients with pressure sores to verify their condition without specifically requesting records creates the potential for the NT to fail to appreciate the true condition of a patient’s pressure sores when they are discharged from hospital and for follow up to be delayed.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
In December 2022 Mr Hurwood was an in-patient at Northampton General Hospital. This followed a fall at home. During this admission he suffered multiple episodes of hypoglycaemia. Mr Hurwood’s insulin medication was to be provided by nurses within the hospital.
 
I have heard evidence from a Diabetes Specialist Nurse at the Diabetes Centre at Northampton General Hospital that on 12 December 2022 Mr Hurwood was referred by ward staff for a diabetes review. The Diabetes Specialist Nurse explained in evidence that she observed that nurses (plural) were administering Mr Hurwood’s insulin after meals. She advised the nurses that Mr Hurwood’s insulin should be provided before his meals.
 
In evidence, the Diabetes Specialist Nurse told me:
 
Insulin should be administered prior eating.
Its effectiveness is reduced if not administered before eating.
This was not the only time that she was aware that nurses at Northampton General Hospital were (incorrectly) administering insulin to patients after they had eaten their meals.
This continues to happen “occasionally”: the most recent episode which she had directly encountered occurred in the last 2 to 3 months.
Whilst the Diabetes Centre members have had discussions with nurses and training does occur “the message does get through for some people”. The implication – which she agreed was the correct implication – was that the “message” did not get through to other nurses.
 
A former Ward Sister at Northampton General Hospital has also given evidence at the inquest. She agreed that staff must get insulin administration correct. She thought the incorrect administration of insulin after a meal “probably does happen”. She accepted that there was “no excuse” for this, but pointed to the possible contributory effect of a lack of staff.",On 18 January 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Mr Leslie Hurwood.

The response by the police service to the first radio transmission by the arresting officer after Liam entered the water was broadly timely and appropriate with regard to the relevant resources being notified.  This was done via electronic messaging from the Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system to most emergency services, such as the RNLI and the London Ambulance Service (LAS).  However, notification to the London Fire Brigade (LFB) by the Police has to be done by telephone as the LFB does not use the more rapid CAD-mediated system to transfer vital life-saving information to it.  The evidence heard at the inquest was that this delays transmission of information to the LFB from the Police by 90 to 120 seconds.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
The lighting of buoyancy aids on the riverside is not adequate, meaning that they are not able to be identified rapidly and then deployed without delay in an emergency situation. 
 
Buoyancy aids are more visible when painted with white stripes and/or reflective white stripes.  However, not all buoyancy aids are so painted, meaning that they are not able to be identified rapidly and then deployed without delay in an emergency situation.
 
The process for alerting the LFB by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) uses a telephone to transmit information from the MPS to the LFB, rather than using a CAD-mediated system to transfer information electronically from the Police to the LPB which is faster than transmitting information by telephone.  This delay means that there is a risk that future deaths could occur due to a delay in the LFB being alerted by the Police and a corresponding delay to the LFB’s subsequent response to an emergency incident.","An investigation was commenced into the death of Liam Stephen Allan aged 23.  The investigation concluded on 17 January 2025.  The conclusion in the inquest was:
 
Liam’s death was an accident.  However, there were some inadequacies by the Police in his arrest and the subsequent rescue attempt that probably more than minimally contributed to his death.  Additionally, there were failures and omissions in the rescue of Liam that possibly, more than minimally, contributed to his death.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
During the inquest I heard evidence that there should be regular repetition of information to patients suffering from treatment resistant schizophrenia about the risks and red flags associated with the side effects of taking Clozapine. Since William’s death Devon Partnership NHS Trust has set up Clozapine clinics which provide the opportunity for staff who are familiar with the side effects associated with Clozapine to discuss these with patients attending for their monthly phlebotomy appointments (required for the purpose of monitoring their white blood cell count). 
 
At these appointments healthcare professionals will specifically ask patients about their smoking habit, caffeine intake, bowel movements, hypersalivation, sedation, nausea, incontinence, heartburn, infection, and medication changes, in addition to open questions about any other side effects a patient might be experiencing.  I am also assured that Devon Partnership NHS Trust will be including additional questions to be discussed at this appointment surrounding recent physical illnesses, palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness and dizziness.
 
Currently around 60% of the cohort of patients prescribed Clozapine who are under the care of Devon Partnership Trust have access to these clinics.  The other 40% will attend their GP surgery for their monthly Clozapine phlebotomy service. The phlebotomy service provided at a GP practice is usually an appointment with a non-qualified member of staff, who will not have been specifically trained in the side effects of Clozapine. I am therefore concerned that the level of care provided to patients attending Clozapine clinics on a monthly basis, is likely to be superior from the care provided to those patients who attend their GP practice. In particular, I am concerned that any discussion and repetition of information surrounding reg flags and side effects associated with Clozapine, and advice about when to seek medical attention, will be significantly more limited for those patients attending their GP practice than for those attending the monthly Clozapine clinics.  I am also concerned that this limitation is likely to extend further than the 40% of patients in receipt of Clozapine under the care of Devon Partnership NHS Trust and that this may be a national issue.
 
At post mortem examination William was found to have a significantly enlarged heart and left ventricular hypertrophy.  This was not known to those caring for William in life. Clozapine is a cardiotoxic drug, and is often used in conjunction with other drugs which may also have a cardiotoxic effect.
 
The risk of myocarditis is reasonably well explained in Devon Partnership NHS Trust’s policy documentation, but there is less of a focus on cardiomyopathies which would include left ventricular hypertrophy. I understand that the Trust’s guidance is based on national guidance.  Annual ECGs are required for patients prescribed Clozapine and questions about cardiac function will now be asked at monthly Clozapine clinics. However, I understand that ECGs are not a diagnostic tool used to assist in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathies such as left ventricular hypertrophy and that left ventricular hypertrophy can be asymptomatic. I also understand that an echocardiogram may be able to identify such cardiomyopathies, but that this is not currently required on initiation of Clozapine or routinely at any other time whilst a patient is taking Clozapine.
 
I am concerned that these cardiomyopathies could therefore go undetected in patients prescribed Clozapine and leave them at unknown increased risk of fatal cardiac arrythmias, as occurred in William’s case. Given that the Trust’s guidance is based on national guidance I am concerned this may be a national issue.
 
It is clear that patients suffering with treatment resistant schizophrenia are complex, and as such there are often a number of different agencies involved in an individual’s care.  In addition, there are often multiple members of the same team involved in an individual’s care. During the inquest it became clear that, at times, communication of important issues was not as clear as it should have been.  I note that Devon Partnership NHS Trust has significant training available for its staff and other agencies it engages with in relation to patients who are prescribed Clozapine. However, it would be of great assistance to understand what Devon Partnership NHS Trust is doing to ensure that optimum communication of key information is achieved within the community mental health team, and when dealing with its other agencies involved in a patient’s care.","On 17 November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Antony NORTHCOTT.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 January 2025.

Jackson Yeow, aged 16 years, suffered autistic spectrum disorder and obesity.  On 28th March 2022 he was assessed by a general practitioner following a history of abdominal pain and vomiting, diagnosed with suspected gastritis, and treated.  On 4th April 2022 his mother became concerned that his symptoms had worsened and sought the assistance of the general practice by telephone.  Jackson was unable to mobilise to attend GP consultation in person and his mother  phoned 999 at 12.13.  Despite subsequent clinical support desk review and further 999 calls, an ambulance service resource was not allocated until after Jackson became unconscious at about 19.30, attending at 20.00.  Jackson was subject to a prolonged extrication from his house with fire service and EMERTS assistance, was intubated and taken to the University Hospital of Wales where he was diagnosed to be suffering diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, cerebral oedema, renal compromise and severe acidosis.  Despite intensive treatment over the subsequent days his condition deteriorated and he died on 9th April 2022.
 
The narrative conclusion which I returned was:
 
Jackson Yeow, aged 16, died of diabetic ketoacidosis following a wait for an ambulance of approximately 9 ½ hours.
 
The Inquest focused upon: –
 
a. The fact that Jackson Yeow’s condition deteriorated on 4th April 2022.  His family contacted his GP and was offered a face to face appointment which he became physically unable to attend.
 
b. His family telephoned 999 at 12.13 on 4th April 2022.
 
c. The ambulance service categorised the call as an amber 1 response, which it characterised as a life threatening call requiring an urgent response.
 
d. The evidence of the ambulance service was that its ability to respond to the call was substantially impaired by the fact that a significant number of its resources were delayed at hospitals awaiting hand over of patients.
 
e. An ambulance did not attend until 20.00 on 4th April 2022, by which time Jackson Yeow had suffered a substantial metabolic derangement, cardiovascular collapse and renal impairment.  He was severely acidotic.
 
f. The first language of the family was not English. Although some clinicians were able to use the services of an interpreter, this was not always employed.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Although the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board did not provide direct care to Jackson Yeow during the period within scope, it provided the evidence of a consultant in emergency medicine to the inquest on the issue of delays in ambulance handovers at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend.  That evidence directly identified the following matters of concern:
 
(1) Care for patients in the emergency department is frequently provided in the corridor and other non clinical spaces, which:
 
a. Impedes efficient clinical assessment, causing clinicians to take longer performing tasks and rendering clinical care more difficult;
 
b. Impedes the ability of staff to recognize a patient’s deteriorating condition;
 
c. Increases patient morbidity through environmental factors compromising a patient’s ability to sleep, hygiene and nutrition.
 
d. May slow the process of ambulance handovers.
 
(2) Care in corridors and other non clinical spaces has been normalized, which in the opinion of the consultant who gave evidence is unsafe.
 
(3) When conducted routinely, care in corridors and other non clinical spaces reduces the capacity of the Emergency Department so that should acuity escalate, it is likely to cause delays to the release of ambulances.
 
(4) The underling obstacle to improving flow through the hospital and relieving pressure on the Emergency Department is the significant number of patients who are medically fit to be discharged but whose discharge is delayed due to non medical reasons.","A Coronial investigation was commenced on 20th April 2022 into the death of Jackson Yeow, aged 16.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted on 15th -16th January 2025.

She asked whether this was necessary again.
 
Her GP made a referral for advice to a hospital. The GP did not mention in the referral that there had been historic instances of recurrent pulmonary embolisms, albeit this did not contribute to Maria’s death.
 
The referral was returned to the GP by an administration officer at the hospital without a clinician seeing the same. The evidence was that this probably made more than a minimal contribution to Maria’s death as a clinician would have advised immediate administration of heparin.
 
The referral was then dealt with by another hospital. The GP was advised by the hospital to refer Maria to the obstetrics service. Thromboprophylaxis was recommended once pregnancy was confirmed. Evidence given was that the clinician that responded to the GP’s referral was not aware of the risk of bleeding associated with heparin as known at that time. With that knowledge, that clinician would have recommended the immediate administration of heparin without waiting for clinical confirmation of pregnancy.
 
The GP endeavoured to contact the obstetric service via the community midwife team. The electronic request was not accessed, due to staff leave, until after Maria’s death on 24 August 2022.
 
The cause of death was recorded as massive recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Evidence was given in the inquest to the effect that medical General Practitioners have no uniform national case management system for electronic storage of patients’ records. This leads to a situation whereby, upon transfer of patient records from one practice to another, the receiving practice is obliged to input all the records afresh if the practices operate different systems. This can lead to delay in the compilation of records.
 
Further, it appears that a case management system is unable to store electronically all historic documents such as referral letters from one clinician to another, due to electronic capacity issues. This leads to a situation where some patient information is stored electronically and some in paper form making it difficult for the GP to note quickly all relevant patient information.",On 23 April 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Maria Simpson.

From January 2023 she had, on a number of occasions, self-harmed and made attempts to take her life in the community, whilst detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983, and whilst a voluntary inpatient. 
 
During this time, Morgan was admitted and discharged from mental health settings, through the consultant led discharge process and via Morgan self-discharging.
 
On the 27 February 2023 Morgan experienced a psychotic episode which resulted in hospital staff being injured.  As a result of this episode, Morgan self-discharged herself.  Whilst in the hospital grounds Morgan attempted to hang herself from a tree and on this occasion, she was detained by the Police under Section 136 Mental Health Act 1983.
 
Morgan was detained in the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit under Section 2 and after assessment the section was rescinded and she was then transferred to Rowan ward on the 3 March 2023, where she remained as a voluntary inpatient.
 
It was assessed that Morgan should be discharged into the community under the care of the Crisis Team on the 6th March 2023.  Whilst waiting for a discharge meeting with the Crisis Team on the 9th March, in the early hours of the morning, Morgan sadly [REDACTED] hung herself.","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
 
There is no policy or guidance to staff for the assessment of risk posed by fixtures and fittings supplied by the Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust).
 
There is therefore the risk that fixtures and fittings supplied and/or not removed by the Trust from patients, who are suffering from acute mental health, are at risk of utilising these items to take their own life.","On 21 March 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Morgan Rose Betchley, formerly Sladovic, aged 19 years.  The investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 22nd November 2024. The conclusion given by the jury was a narrative conclusion namely:
 
Morgan died as a result of her own actions. Historical evidence suggests that in all probability Morgan’s intent had been to self-harm as a cry for help and that it was not her intention to end her life. Morgan was a young vulnerable adult who had suffered with her mental health for many years, including a history of self-harm and suicidal ideations.  Following a significant decline in her mental health she was admitted and Sectioned (under Section 2 and Section 136) on multiple occasions to several medical facilities for her safety and to receive an enhanced level of care.
 
The evidence shows repeated failures to follow policies and procedures by the staff at Meadowfield Hospital. Failures relating to admission process, understanding of existing diagnoses, risk management, record keeping, family involvement and discharge planning prevented Morgan from receiving access to services she needed at the time. We consider it probable that if policies and procedures had been followed Morgan would have benefitted from a level of care more closely aligned to her complex needs, including her diagnosis of Autism.
 
In the days running up to Morgan’s death, there was a failure to act professionally by some members of hospital staff. Following an earlier incident of assault, the deceased’s attempts to apologise were not handled in a professional manner by senior staff members of Rowan Ward, leading to a fractured therapeutic relationship. Whilst nursing staff did not actively exclude Morgan from receiving care, the situation was made unnecessarily stressful for Morgan.
 
The evidence of the court focused on the frequency of observations on the night of Morgan’s death. However, whilst it’s possible that more frequent observations may have helped to better understand her level of risk, we feel it more probable that better quality observations and interactions would have led to a great understanding of Morgan’s state of mind.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27th February 2025 I, the coroner, may extend the period.

At the time of his admission Victor lacked mental capacity and was identified as being at high risk of dehydration and malnutrition, requiring assistance to promote his fluid and oral intake.  Plans were put in place for his weight to be monitored and recorded weekly.
 
The Court heard evidence that on the 2nd January 2024, Victor was seen by his GP and although there was some discussion in respect of his poor dietary intake, the GP was not informed of the 5kg of weight that Victor had lost within the preceding 12 days, nor was the GP provided with the details of the limited amount of fluid that Victor was taking at that time. 
 
On the 4th January 2024, Victor was booked onto the GP triage list following concerns being raised by staff in respect of his fluid and oral intake.  The Court heard evidence that the GP made three attempts to contact the Home but there was no answer with no follow up being made by the Home in respect of the missed appointment.
 
The Court heard evidence from the GP that Victor was seen again on the 9th January 2024 by which time he had become too frail for his weight to be measured.  At the time of the review, Victor’s fluid intake was very low but the details recorded by the Home were not provided to the GP so as to form part of his assessment, nor was the GP informed that Victor had become too frail to weigh. 
 
The Court heard evidence that on the 11th January 2024, Victor was reviewed via telephone by the community dietician who was informed that Victor’s weight had been steady since early December but that he was refusing to eat and required encouragement to drink.  It was accepted that the information in respect of Victor’s weight was not accurate given that he had lost 5kg since his admission to the Home.
 
Later that day, a telephone call was made by the Home to the next of kin, in which it was reported that Victor was very poorly, his clinical observations indicating very low blood pressure and a high pulse rate.  Evidence was heard that attempts were made that day to contact both the GP and the Urgent Community Response team, but to no avail with no further steps being taken at that time, to obtain medical treatment for Victor.
 
Overnight, Victor’s condition did not improve, it being noted that Victor was very poorly.  A call was initially made to the GP at 14.53 hours followed by a request for an ambulance at 15.11 hours.
 
On admission to Hospital, the Court heard evidence that Victor had an acute kidney injury and hypernatremia secondary to being grossly dehydrated and malnourished,   with Victor having developed osmotic demyelination syndrome, a rare neurological complication of hypernatremia. 
 
Attempts were made to treat Victor, however his condition continued to deteriorate and he passed away on the 20th January 2024.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
 
The evidence highlighted that the only internal investigation that took place in respect of the care provided to Victor was in the context of safeguarding and as a consequence of a request from the Local Authority, under section 42 of the Care Act 2014, following the submission of safeguarding referrals by the Hospital after Victor’s death.
 
Although an internal review of the care arrangements in place for Victor took place alongside the internal investigation, the purpose of this was to identify any further opportunities to strengthen existing procedures, rather than to identify any areas of learning and improvements that could have been made in respect of Victor’s care.
 
The evidence highlighted that there had been little reflection upon the events leading up to Victor’s death, with no facility for the identification of any missed opportunities to provide or obtain care for Victor prior to his final admission to hospital.
 
The evidence highlighted that there was no mechanism for lessons to be learned from deaths which occur during or following admission to the Nursing Home.","On the 7th February 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Victor William Knowles.
 
Victor died on the 20th January 2024.  He was 79 years old.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 12th December 2024. The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome caused by 1b Hypernatremia due to 1c Dehydration; and 2 Frailty of old age.
 
I recorded a narrative conclusion that Victor died of a rare neurological complication of hypernatremia as a consequence of dehydration and malnourishment and that Victor’s death was contributed to by Neglect.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisations have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27th February 2025.

That policy was complied with. It was appropriate not to arrest Mr Taylor at the outset of the investigation, so he was voluntarily interviewed and he was released under investigation for a two year period. Within a fortnight of him being made aware that criminal charges had been authorised, he intentionally took a large quantity of prescription medication and was found deceased at his home address on 3 January 2024.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
When a suspect is arrested for offences requiring a referral to a mental health nurse, commonly referred to in Nottinghamshire as “Liaison and Diversion” the custody sergeant makes that referral automatically, which allows the opportunity for a suspect to obtain assistance from a healthcare professional, if they desire. In addition, there are welfare assessments conducted by the officer in charge of the investigation. In cases where a suspect is interviewed on a voluntary basis for relevant offences, the suspect is not dealt with at a custody suite and a referral to a mental health nurse is not automatic. In this latter scenario, only welfare assessments are completed by the officer in charge of the investigation without any involvement from healthcare services.","On 29th April 2024 an inquest was opened into the death of Paul Ian Taylor, aged 58.

She was found by a family member and transported to hospital by ambulance. Investigations at hospital found Ms Karakoc had suffered a hypoxic brain injury which was not survivable. Ms Karakoc died on 2 December 2023.
 
Following Ms Karakoc’s death, toxicological examination revealed that the catalyst for the chain of events leading to Ms Karakoc’s death was [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] toxicity. Ms Karakoc was not prescribed either of these medications by her General Practitioner and the General Practitioner was unaware of Ms Karakoc taking those medications.
 
Ms Karakoc’s family provided evidence which proved that Ms Karakoc obtained these medications from online sources via websites set up to sell prescription medication off-label. Ms Karakoc made over 100 purchases of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] in a period of a little over a year. The ready availability of medications such as these to purchase from websites circumvents the patient safety measures in place and places vulnerable persons at risk of death.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows  –
 
1. There is evidence of search engines readily returning websites which sell prescription medications, including those that sell highly addictive sleeping tablets and painkillers which can and do cause fatalities. I am concerned how readily search engines return websites such as these;
 
2. I am concerned that the current system for monitoring the legitimacy of supply chains for medications available in England and Wales via prescription is not preventing the ready supply of such medications online;
 
3. There is evidence that banks form a legitimate part of the supply chain, and that this is crucial to the functioning of these criminal enterprises. I am concerned that the current system for detecting such criminal enterprises and alerting the relevant authorities is not effective.  
 
I am not reassured that necessary actions to address the serious issue identified are in place.","On 7 March 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Susan Marie Karakoc.
 
The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 November 2024.
 
The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion:
 
Susan Marie Karakoc sought to treat her symptoms of fibromyalgia with [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] which she obtained from websites selling prescription medication off-label. Susan had levels of [REDACTED] associated with fatalities and [REDACTED] at a potentially toxic level. Those medications taken together acted synergistically to depress Susan’s cardiorespiratory system which led to her suffering hypoxic brain injury which in turn caused her to suffer multiple organ failure which led to her death.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action in relation to at least one of the concerns identified herein.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 10 February 2025.

A few days later, Mrs Leake underwent heart valve surgery as planned, but she was then mistakenly released from hospital without having fitted the ICD which she needed.
 
Three days after she was released from hospital Mrs Leake suffered a cardiac arrhythmia of the type which an ICD is designed to address, and she died as a result.
 
I found that the failure to fit the ICD was causative of Mrs Leake’s death and it amounted to neglect.
 
The decision of the MDT to fit the ICD was overlooked by the doctors who released Mrs Leake from hospital because the note of the MDT meeting which made this decision was not recorded on the medical notes which they were working from.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
Mrs Leake received treatment from three hospital teams: cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery and coronary intensive care.  Each team uses their own ward-based medical notes which are not accessible by the other teams.  Whilst each team has access to the iPortal system on which Mrs Leake’s MDT decision was stored, it was apparent that this was not accessed and acted upon.  As a result, the MDT decision regarding Mrs Leake’s ICD was overlooked.
Plans to introduce electronic patient records to which all medical teams have access are still at an early stage and no date has been identified for moving over to a single electronic notes system.
The steps which the Trust has taken as a result of Mrs Leake’s death to address the risk of MDT decisions being missed in the future still rely upon the manual transcription of decisions from one set of medical notes to another, with the continuing potential for human error and important decisions about treatment being overlooked.","On 13th June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anne Patricia Leake, aged 67. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9th December 2024.

Earlier that day a fire had to be seen coming from the ground floor flat of the address.
Tim was seen by a witness to close the window of the flat whilst it was on fire, then disappear from view.
Tim made no attempt to leave, and when found was sat or slumped against the door of the room.
Timothy was known to the mental health services, and had a prolonged history of being mentally unwell (being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2004), with evidence of a previous stated suicidal thought.
A subsequent post-mortem examination identified that Tim had died from smoke inhalation and burns.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you;
 
the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. —
 
I am concerned of the continuing lack of Mental Health Unit inpatient beds in Suffolk, and more widely throughout England and Wales.
 
At the time of Tim’s mental health crisis on the 2 February 2024, had the decision to admit him been possible, he still would not have been admitted as there were five other individuals in the queue before him also waiting for admission.
 
The lack of available beds is not a new problem, and I have previously issued two Regulation 28 Prevention of Future Death Reports in which a lack of inpatient Mental Health Unit beds have contributed to a death-
 
Nicola Rayner (died 10″ June 2023), reported 7″ March 2024.
Piotr Kierzkowski (died 17 December 2019), reported 12″ October

In Tim’s case, on the 2″ of February 2024 Tim’s family, Tim himself, and Tim’s Mental Health Care Coordinator (a Senior Mental Health Nurse who had been supporting Tim for a year), all wished for his admission to a Mental Health Unit as a voluntary patient.
 
It was heard in evidence that a different team (the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team) were the ‘gatekeepers’ for admission and this team could not review Tim until the next day.
 
When reviewed by Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team staff (who had never met Tim before), they believed his crisis had subsided and his admission was denied.
 
In evidence Tim’s Mental Health Care Coordinator was adamant that Tim should have been hospitalised on the 2″ February, as both his family and Tim himself had also wished.","On 6 February 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of
 
Timothy Robert DE BOOS
 
The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:-
 
The effects of a self-ignited fire at his home address, whilst suffering a relapse of his known psychotic illness.

1a Smoke inhalation and severe burns

Narrative Conclusion – Huw Irwin Erasmus was at risk of eating vegetation present in the grounds of the Aderyn Unit in Pontypool. Huw died from the toxic effects of consuming a large quantity of Yew leaves in the grounds. Those responsible for his care ought to have known that Yew trees were present, and the leaves were highly toxic and could be fatal if ingested.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
I appreciate it has been almost a year before this inquest was concluded so the change in road layout may now be more known to regular drivers, however people unfamiliar with the road may also need to navigate the roundabout.  The Officer in the Case, an experienced Serious Collision Investigation Officer, raised concerns regarding the signage of 2 aspects of this area of road:
Firstly, although the road markings which indicate the centre lane can also be used for left hand turning vehicles was regarded as clear, the officer felt there was insufficient actual road signage to assist road users in how the roundabout can be navigated.  This was of particular concern as this is a busy roundabout with a build up of traffic and so markings on the road are often obscured.
Secondly, there is a dual use path for both pedestrians and cyclists as well as the availability of a Toucan Crossing.  This provides cyclists with an alternative to using the road.  Again, evidence was heard that there was inappropriate signage to instruct cyclists that this route was available.","On 19th December 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gary Stephen DUNN, aged 47 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 2nd December, 2024.
 
The conclusion of the inquest was:
Road Traffic Incident
 
The following findings of fact were made:
Lorry White Volvo LGV registration H4 LGE
Mr Dunn was riding a bicycle.
Neither vehicle had any defects.
No weather conditions were contributory to the incident.
There was no defect in the road that was contributory to the incident.
I do acknowledge that the road had changed it markings, this was a relatively recent change.
I acknowledge that there was an alternative route for Mr Dunn to navigate the busy roundabout, however Mr Dunn was within his rights to use the road.
The issue of whether Mr DUNN was visible at any time was an issue at inquest.  The driver of the LGV could not recall specifics about his mirror checks but stated a number of times that it was instinctive, constant thing, something that he does all the time.  He was open about the fact that he did not see Mr DUNN at any time.  I do find his evidence credible.
When Mr Dunn is in a position where he could be started to be regarded as visible, he is approximately 70 metres from the roundabout.  I accept there was an opportunity for the LGV to see Mr Dunn and recognise him as a road user, but I also recognise that for the majority of the time Mr DUNN was in the inside lane, there were other vehicles on the road and the driver of the LGV would have also been looking to negotiate the roundabout. 
Mr Dunn did have lights on his bike but he was not wearing any clothing that would make him more visible.  As stated previously, the driver of the LGV reported that at no time did he see him.  At the time that the presence of Mr DUNN would have indicated a risk, he would have been in the blind spot of the LGV, high visibility clothing at that stage not have made a difference.
This is relevant when at the give way line, albeit for a short period of time, Mr Dunn was positioned in the LGV driver’s blind spot before both move to negotiate the roundabout.
The 1st lane of the roundabout is marked for those to leave the roundabout at the first junction.  The 2nd lane of the roundabout allows users to both leave the roundabout at the 1st junction and also continue travelling forward on the roundabout.
As the vehicles leave the give way line, the LGV is indicating to take the first junction.  Mr Dunn was positioned very close to the cab.  It would not be possible to say whether he noticed the indicator.
As both the LGV and Mr Dunn leave the roundabout, they are both positioned in lanes that allow exit via the first junction.  Mr Dunn is, however, not visible to the LGV driver.  Mr Dunn is straddling both the 1st and 2nd lane and is going to travel straight over the roundabout.
CCTV shows that as the LGV manoeuvres to take it’s exit, Mr Dunn rides across its front directly in its path.  I note that the lorry does not cross the bicycles path, it does not leave it’s lane.  It is evident that Mr Dunn does not appreciate that the vehicle was indicating to turn left at the 1st junction.  At the time that the LGV takes its junction Mr Dunn may have been trying either to cycle quickly to out-manoeuvre the vehicle, or attempting to cut across the front of the LGV to reach the next junction, however the CCTV seems to indicate he simply does not appreciate the lorry is turning left and he carries on his route which takes him in front of the LGV.  It was a quick misjudgement, with very tragic consequences.
At the time the bicycle crosses his path, there was nothing that the driver of the LGV could do to avoid the collision.
I find the LGV stopped appropriately.  For the avoidance of doubt, I accept the evidence that the tachograph did not show that this slowing was in an attempt to avoid the accident.
I do note that Mr DUNN was not wearing a cycling helmet, however given the gravity of his injuries, this piece of equipment would not have saved his life.
Mr DUNN’s death was instantaneous.
Toxicology revealed previous exposure to cocaine and tramadol in his system, but no evidence of acute toxicity.
I note that the dashcam was not seized immediately, and then there was a discrepancy over who seized it.  I accept that one officer seized the LGV and the dashcam together but another then seized the dashcam itself.  I note that the override on the dashcam was continuous even when the engine was running, and as such there was no dashcam footage.  I appreciate that when officers attend these scenes there are many tasks and priorities, but it is regrettable that this footage was not seized immediately.  This is something that could have given comfort to the family.  However we do have the CCTV footage and while it does not give a view from the cab it does provide a record of the incident.

1a – head injury
1b – road traffic collision
 
Section 3 of the Record of Inquest (which answered how, when and where Jay Whiting came by his death) was determined as follows:
 
‘Jay Whiting was the sole occupant of a vehicle registered to him when he was driving northbound on Embankment Road, Plymouth, in the early hours on 7 January 2023.  Jay lost control, and was then unable to regain control, of the vehicle, owing to a number of relevant factors, including very wet weather and significant water collection on the road, the poor condition of the vehicle’s rear tyres and the reclined position of the driver’s seat.  Jay’s vehicle left the road and hit a mature tree, which was situated on the pavement adjacent to the carriageway.  The collision of the vehicle with the tree resulted in Jay suffering fatal injuries.  Despite initial resuscitation by attending paramedics and transport to Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, Jay died there in the neuro-intensive care unit later on 7 January 2023.’",During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed one matter giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

Emma had a history of opiate dependence and on the 22nd February 2023, she began a period in a detoxification and rehabilitation placement in Cornwall in order to become abstinent from methadone so she could progress to therapy treatment for her mental health diagnoses. Prior to this she had experienced a period of relative stability with her mental health. During this placement the methadone prescription was reduced more quickly than she had experienced before, and she became emotionally dysregulated. Her mental health deteriorated, and her acts of self harm increased as a result of which she was taken to the local hospital in Cornwall. The placement was ended on the 7th March as it was felt her risks were too high to be managed in that setting. On the 14th March 2023 Emma was taken to the Emergency Department at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth after she disclosed that she had taken an overdose of her prescribed medication. At this time the hospital was experiencing extreme capacity pressures and Emma was placed in the cohorting corridor which was being staffed by paramedics due to the capacity pressures. At 18.58 hours, when for a very short period of time there were no staff in the corridor, Emma can be seen on the CCTV of the corridor to secret upon her person a nasal canula with plastic tubing from an equipment trolley. At 19.53 hours Emma went to the toilet in the Emergency Department. At 20.03 hours, Emma was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition on the floor of the toilet with a ligature fashioned from nasal canula tubing around her neck. Following attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation there was a return of spontaneous circulation, and she was admitted to the critical care unit at the hospital where she continued to receive care, however her condition deteriorated, and she died on the 19th March 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
 
During the inquest evidence was heard that:
 
1). At the time of her death Emma had a Frequent Attender Care plan, or as they are now known a High Intensity Use Care Plan, in place. This plan was agreed by representatives from Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (DHUFT) who provide the mental health care across Dorset, a representative from the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, a representative from Poole Hospital and a representative from We Are With You (WAWY) who supported Emma with her substance misuse. The aims of this plan for Emma were:
 
 – to provide a consistent approach when Emma presented to the emergency department
 – to streamline her care so that she does not have to wait any longer than necessary in the ED as she has identified this makes her feel worse
 – to minimise the impact on emergency department resources when Emma attends
 – to reduce the use of restrictive interventions which may exacerbate Emma’s distress
 
2). South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWAST), who provide the paramedic care in the South West, were not provided with the plan prior to the 14th March 2023, nor were other hospitals Emma may present to, such as the other local hospital in Dorset, Dorset County Hospital, or the hospital in Cornwall where Emma was taken to when she self harmed on the 5th March 2023 during her time at the detoxification and rehabilitation placement.
 
3). On the 14th March 2023, due to the capacity issues the cohorting area was opened at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital and representatives from SWAST were caring for the patients in the cohorting area. When Emma arrived at the hospital, she was taken to the cohorting area and was booked into the hospital by the triage nurse from the hospital, although was not seen by them and her previous records were not accessed.
 
4). There can be a delay in accessing the hospital patient record when a patient arrives at the hospital as following the booking in process, there needs to be a merger of the ambulance paperwork to verify they have the correct person before the hospital patient record can be accessed. The process adopted by different hospitals may cause a delay in access to the hospital patient record and evidence was given that at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital this could be anything up to 10 minutes from experience.
 
5). When Emma arrived at the hospital she was booked in by the triage nurse between 18.49 and 18.52 hours, however the merger of her records did not happen until 18.59 hours. No representative from the hospital saw Emma prior to her death and she was monitored by the SWAST paramedics in the cohorting area, so there was no access to her patient record which detailed her significant history of self harm and the Frequent Attender Care Plan. The Frequent Attender Care Plan was not followed throughout the 1 hour and 47 minutes Emma was with professionals from when SWAST attended her home address until the time she was last seen prior to her death. Had it been accessed, and followed, there would have been opportunities to discuss with Emma further support for her whilst she was at the hospital and the evidence given by the witnesses who had contact with her that day was that they would have considered managing her care differently.
 
6). University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust, of which the Royal Bournemouth Hospital forms part, have taken action internally to ensure that a person’s records are now available when a person arrives at the hospital and this would include access to Frequent Attender Care Plans, however evidence was given that a similar process around the merger of records is undertaken at other hospitals across the South West, from the experience of SWAST, and this may also be a national issue.
 
7). The Summary Care Record (SCR) is accessible to a variety of healthcare professionals and accessible to SWAST.","On the 4th April 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Emma Victoria Sanders, aged 34 years.

She had last been spoken to in a telephone call on 30 March 2024.,"In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.  In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
 
I am concerned that measures are not in place at Macklin Street Surgery and Daynight pharmacy to prevent prescription of excess medication to patient’s recognised to be at risk of overdose, either intentional or unintentional, who are ordinarily issued shorter period repeat prescriptions to reduce those risks. This situation arises when early prescriptions are issued due to statutory holiday periods when most pharmacies are likely to be closed. I have been informed that measures have been introduced to prevent excess prescribing by taking account of single day bank holidays, but there are no measures relating to longer bank holiday periods (e.g. Easter). With electronic patient record and data systems it seems a reasonable presumption that suitable solutions can be identified.
 
As I imagine that the substance of my concern is likely to apply to other GP practices and pharmacies, I have also sent this report to the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS Derby and Derbyshire Integrated Care Board.","On 11 April 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Margaret Mary Feeney aged 78. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 November 2024.  The conclusion of the inquest was that: –
 
Margaret died due to taking excess prescribed medication which she had become dependent on and addicted to. She had access to excess medication because of medical prescribing decisions and arrangements leading up to a bank holiday period.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 20, 2025.  I, the coroner, may extend the period.

He had a history of diagnosed mental health and was concordant with medication for Schizophrenia. He enjoyed a good relationship with his mental health nurses and GP and was deemed capacitous throughout his treatment in recent years.
 
Colin had a good and loving relationship with his daughter and with his sister.
 
Colin elected to live in a house which did not have fully functioning mains services due to a variety of reasons. He received advice on his living situation from various agencies, but he appeared to be content in his way of life. This self-neglect however meant that he did not always keep his house warm although he did have a coal fire and access to oil heaters, and he did cook his own meals when not at family members’ houses.
There had been attempts at helping Colin access repairs for his house following various admissions to hospital and a safeguarding referral was made by the Safeguarding Adults team at Hull Royal Infirmary on 13th February 2023 as Colin was about to be discharged home from hospital and his house needed work. The Independence and Advice Hub were to screen that referral, but Colin was discharged home before contact was made with him.
 
On 6th March 2023 Colin was assigned a social worker and support was offered. Colin was offered alternative living arrangements for a short while but declined with capacity to make his own decisions.
 
On the 7th March 2023, the social worker once again visited Colin, and this time support was accepted from the Red Cross. On 8th March Colin was discharged home. Due to ongoing concerns a Vulnerable Adults Risk Management (VARM) meeting was suggested.
 
The Red Cross did support Colin but raised concerns about his house. Colin declined further support on 10th March 2023 but said he knew what to do if he needed support in the future.
 
A VARM meeting was not held, which was an accepted missed opportunity by East Riding Adult Social Care and Health.
 
Colin’s hospital admissions prior to his death concerned a general decline and hypothermia and he was warmed up at hospital.
 
Colin’s daughter arranged to visit Colin on 26th March but upon attendance there was no response to knocking or phone calls. She rang the police with a concern for welfare call. She was advised this was a health concern and as such under the Right Care Right Person Policy she should ring for an ambulance which she duly did at 17:57. The call was answered at 17:59 which constituted a delay of 1 minute and 50 seconds.
 
The call was coded as a Category 3 call, which on the information provided was the correct category. The caller was advised the service was extremely busy but was not advised how long the delay was likely to be.
 
Calls were made to the patient, but the line was constantly engaged as reported by his daughter.
 
At 03:35 on 27th March 2023 an ambulance arrived at Colin’s house. This was response time of 9 hours and 38 minutes was accepted by Yorkshire Ambulance to be an excessive response time.
 
Colin was seen through the window collapsed and the fire and rescue service were summonsed by ambulance to attend and effect entry which they did at 04:00 hours.
Colin was critically unwell when the ambulance crew assessed him, and he was conveyed under blue lights and sirens Hull Royal Infirmary who were pre alerted by the ambulance that he was en route.
 
Despite best efforts at Hull Royal Infirmary, Colin sadly passed away at 15:00 hours on the 27th March at Hull Royal Infirmary. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Due to excessive handover times at Hull Royal Infirmary on that date Colin was not handed over to Emergency Department staff until 05:48 hours, having arrived at the emergency Department at 04:27 hours. This was a delay of 1 hour and 21 minutes.
 
At 02:58 on 27th March 2023 the CSP level was escalated to Level 3, as Category 3 response times had increased to 10 hours and 5 minutes. A total of 160 ambulance hours were lost on that date waiting for patient transfer at Hull Royal Infirmary which equates to 16 x 10 hr ambulance shifts.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
No Vulnerable Adult Risk Management meeting was held despite multifactorial concerns with Mr Wiles’ comorbities and self neglect leading to poor living conditions and increased risk to his safety
 
It does not seem clear whether callers are advised to call the emergency services back if they continue to have concerns.
 
The waiting times for ambulances to hand over patients at Hull Royal Infirmary were excessive that day leading to 160 hours of lost ambulance time.
 
 There appears to be an issue with no criteria to reside patients and the ability to hand over patients into ED in Hull Royal Infirmary who arrive in emergency ambulances.","On 11th April 2023 an inquest was opened and adjourned into the death of Colin Wiles aged 79 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25th October 2024, the conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion.
 
Conclusion: Narrative – Colin Wiles died at Hull Royal Infirmary following admission for a collapse at home. Multifactorial issues led to a worsening of pre-existing health conditions and hypothermia which were contributed to by self-neglect.
 
 
His medical cause of death was recorded as:
 
1a. Type 2 Respiratory Failure

The Trust undertook a root cause analysis together with involving the UKHSA  and its own infection and microbiological teams, but no definitive source for the outbreak was found.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
(1)  There is no requirement for a section 10 exempt entity to report any of its findings to the MHRA or indeed to other Trusts or the industry in general if an adverse event occurs.
(2) The current reporting structures (for a section 10 entity) involve reporting to NHSE and the CQC but the threshold or necessity for such reporting appears unclear and, in essence, up to the Trust.
(3) There may be times when section 10 entities reach conclusions which would assist the wider industry and help to assist both other Trusts and commercial organisations in assessing their own risks and improving the provision of highly specific medication to a group of vulnerable patients.
(4) the same may also be true of commercial organisations but they have the power of the MHRA controlling and effecting recalls and actions and the wider dissemination of information.","In 2014 an investigation was commenced into the death of Yousef Al-Kharboush (born 23rd May 2014, died 1st June 2014, aged 8 days), Oscar Barker (born 27 May 2014, died 29 June 2014, aged 1 Month) and Aviva Otte (born 10 October 2013, died 2 January 2014, aged 2 months).

In March 2022, John underwent a kidney transplant at Manchester Royal Infirmary and subsequently received follow-up care and regular reviews at the Royal Derby Hospital (RDH). He was first admitted to George Eliot Hospital (GEH) on 2 December 2023, presenting with rectal bleeding and a persistent cough.
 
Evidence was presented that GEH, like many hospitals, does not have an in-house renal team. As a result, GEH relied on telephone consultations with specialist hospitals for advice on investigations and treatment for renal-related issues.
 
During John’s treatment, the team at GEH sought guidance from both RDH and University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW), the latter being the nearest specialist centre. Following John’s admission, tests were ordered to rule out cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. However, without receiving these test results, John was discharged on 6 December, despite evidence suggesting he was still very unwell. He was re-admitted via emergency ambulance on 8 December. Unsuccessful attempts were made to test for the presence of CMV during his stay at GEH.
 
John’s condition continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to UHCW on 21 December. A diagnosis was not made until 28 December, when tests showed he had 27 million copies of CMV per milliliter of blood, an extremely high count. Treatment with ganciclovir and anti-CMV immunoglobulin was commenced. By this stage, it is likely that John had developed CMV encephalitis. He was intubated and ventilated, but his condition declined, leading to multiple organ failure. John died on 30 December 2023.
 
Evidence was received that whilst CMV rarely causes more than cold or flu-like symptoms in the general population, it is one of the most common infectious complications of solid organ transplantation and is reported to increase graft loss and patient mortality. It was acknowledged that an earlier diagnosis and treatment of CMV could have potentially changed the outcome for John and would have increased the likelihood of successful treatment.
 
Consultants from both hospitals testified that, due to the junior doctors’ strike, they had to assume additional responsibilities and manage a higher patient load, which affected their ability to maintain a consistent overview of patients’ conditions and treatments. In John’s case, the impact was the failure to notice that the test results had not been received at both GEH and UHCW.
The patient safety incident investigation by GEH identified human error and systemic issues in handling CMV testing and the care of renal patients:",:,:,:,:,:,"['https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-0618-Response-1-from-George-Eliot-Hospital-NHS-Trust.pdf', 'https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-0618-Response-2-from-George-Eliot-Hospital-NHS-Trust.pdf', 'https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-0618-Response-1-from-Coventry-and-Warwickshire-Partnership-Trust.pdf', 'https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-0618-Response-2-from-Coventry-and-Warwickshire-Partnership-Trust.pdf', 'https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-0618-Response-from-NHS-England.pdf', 'https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-0618-Response-from-UKKA-and-BTS.pdf']"

Lacey was 11 when she had suffered over a week of varying abdominal pains associated with nausea, vomiting, constipation and low-grade fever. After approx. 10 days her mother had a telephone consultation with her GP. Some of her symptoms appeared to be settling and it was determined she had been/was suffering from a viral illness. She was given safety netting advice.
 
Three days later she re-presented to another GP at the same practice who considered she had appendicitis; she was transferred to hospital. There she was seen by A&E and surgical doctors. The registrar did not consider she had appendicitis but perhaps another diagnosis and arranged for her to be reviewed on the ward later the same day. She went home in the interim at about 0200 (24/4//2021). The consultant reviewed her later that day and considered she was unwell but could not reach a diagnosis. He arranged for an urgent abdominal ultrasound, +/- CT scan. Those investigations revealed a retrocaecal, perforated appendix with abscess formation and right sided hydronephrosis. The evidence was that the appendix had likely perforated before the original GP telephone review (20/4/2021).
 
Lacey was transferred to a specialist paediatric unit for operation the following day (25/4/2021) but developed a duodenal ulcer and coagulopathy as a result of her condition. The appendix was removed but Lacey had an extremely stormy post-operative period. That post operative period included further operations, leaving her abdomen open, on-going coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation and ultimately widespread multiorgan failure. Despite the input of 2 further hospitals, she did not survive and died on 4/6/2021 at 17.25hrs
 
The Inquest also heard expert evidence from a Consultant Paediatric Surgeon who explained that
(1) Acute Retrocaecal appendicitis occurs in about one-third of acute appendicitis presentations
(2) that it is difficult to determine as its presentation is not ‘classical’ in terms of right sided abdominal pain and presenting symptoms
(3) it therefore often presents late and following perforation and with complications already present, and
(4) the availability of abdominal ultrasound +/- CT scan is therefore critical in diagnosing its presentation.
 
The court also heard about the Surgical Abdominal Pathway and ‘Getting It Right First Time’ (re appendicitis) and the NICE guidelines (about which there is a brief reference to retrocaecal appendicitis).
 
However, from the evidence I heard in court, I do not consider there is sufficient knowledge and awareness and therefore consideration from junior staff in relation to this particular type of presentation of acute appendicitis.  In addition, the importance of carrying out an abdominal ultrasound (+/- CT) was highlighted.  The evidence was that this could only be provided by the on-call radiologist, which therefore restricted its availability and assistance in making the diagnosis.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
1. Neither the original GP, the reviewing surgical SHO or surgical registrar considered that Lacey had appendicitis.  The Consultant surgeon reviewing Lacey on the 24th, considered she was ill but could not reach a diagnosis.
2. Despite the slant of available literature, it was evident retrocaecal appendicitis presentation is not a rare presentation of either acute appendicitis or generalised abdominal pain (both common presenting features in the young)
3. The availability and use of bedside/ departmental ultrasound scanning in abdominal pain (e.g. in the young) at any time, but especially out of hours
4. The training of doctors in considering the diagnosis as a possible differential to generalised abdominal pain.","On 18.6.2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lacey May Brookman, aged 11.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11.10.2024.

At approximately 21:13 hours on 19th December 2022, Daniel PINKNEY was driving his Ford Focus motor car in a northerly direction on the A164 in the Skidby area. He encountered a large amount of surface water on his carriageway whilst travelling at approximately 50 miles per hour. His vehicle was subject to aquaplaning and consequent loss of directional control. As a result, he entered the opposite carriageway and collided with a third party vehicle travelling in the Hessle-bound direction. The force of the impact was such that the engine of Mr. PINKNEY’s vehicle broke free of its mountings and came to lie 28 metres from the vehicle. Mr. PINKNEY suffered devastating head and other injuries which were unsurvivable, and he was declared deceased by paramedics in his vehicle at 21:57 hours on 19th December 2022. Both of the involved vehicles were free from mechanical defects which could have caused or contributed to the accident.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The Yorkshire Ambulance Service Patient Transport Service was booked by Ms Townend to take her to her vascular appointment on 5th October 2024. Unfortunately, when they attended to take her, they were unable to do so as one crew member was not able to mobilise Ms Townend safely to the vehicle due to her limited mobility.
As a result, Ms Townend cancelled the appointment, and a further appointment was rebooked for 12th October 2024.
 
On 6th October 2023 carers observed Ms Townend struggling to sit up. A Health Care Assistant (HCA) from the Community Nurses’ Team attended and was concerned as to Ms Townend’s foot and the level of exudate. Her toe was black underneath. The HCA sent photographs to a senior nurse who determined Ms Townend should be seen the following day by a registered nurse.
 
The next day, 7th October 2023, the registered nurse attended at the same time as a carer in the morning. Ms Townend presented as vacant and confused. An ambulance was called. Her leg was warm and swollen. A black necrotic area was noted to her foot.
Ms Townend’s daughters also attended at this time. Her daughter described a smell of dead flesh and her mother being delirious and slumped in a chair and having been in the same clothes for 2 days.
The ambulance took her to hospital. She had a cardiac arrest on the way but was resuscitated.
 
As a result of what the ambulance practitioner witnessed, she submitted a Safeguarding Adult Concern to East Riding of Yorkshire Council regarding neglect and acts of omission due to the care she had received and the injury to her foot
 
On admission to Hull Royal Infirmary, she had an infection to her left foot and sepsis.
Bacteria was found on her foot which caused an infection leading to sepsis.
She was given antibiotics and the next day had a debridement and amputation of 2 toes.
 
Although initially there was clinical improvement in Ms Townend’s condition she deteriorated and despite treatment died on 15th October 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
There was a referral to Adults Safeguarding from both Yorkshire Ambulance Service and Hull Royal Infirmary regarding concerns as to the care Ms Townend had received.
 
As a result of the referrals there was a review that was deemed necessary.
However, the quality of that review was lacking.
 
The Safeguarding Adult Review that took place did not probe the responses received appropriately from the care company and the Community Nurses in any way.
 
In evidence it was heard that the procedure adopted did not record how the responses had been obtained. The family’s input was not recorded. The process happened hastily and the review not to the appropriate standards that would have been of any benefit.
 
The outcomes of the review and recommendations were not provided to the subjects of the review.
In evidence it was heard that there was a lack of professional curiosity and the full review process not followed or documented properly.
 
The importance of Safeguarding reviews must not be underestimated. They are in place to identify concerns and prevent any such issues occurring in the future. The procedure conducted needs to be looked at to avoid any impact on anyone else.","On 18th October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Janet Brown Townend, aged 80 years.

The assessment subsequently undertaken by the MHLT practitioner was inadequate and failed to appropriately act upon relevant information available to him including (but not limited to) information provided by Jamie’s mother regarding her son’s on-going suicidal ideation and her (and Jamie’s) expressed request for him to be admitted to hospital as a voluntary in-patient as she, and Jamie, did not feel able to keep him safe.
 
Although the MHLT clinician gave evidence that he had concluded that Jamie required and would benefit from a period of admission as an in-patient, no such admission was sought or planned.  Instead, Jamie was discharged home with a plan for him to be seen the following day by the Home Treatment Team. He was provided with a (daily) tablet of Zopiclone for the next seven days. Within hours Jamie had taken his own life having fallen a significant height from a window at his home address.
 
The failure by the MHLT practitioner to initiate the process for Jamie’s admission to an in-patient bed constituted a clear missed opportunity to ensure appropriate and likely effective steps were taken to mitigate his high risk of acting upon his clear suicidal ideation.
 
The cumulative effect of the series of serious failures in the six months preceding the events of the 3rd of June amounted to a gross failure to provide Jamie with basic medical care at a time that his condition clearly required it.  In this respect, neglect directly and more than minimally contributed to Jamie’s death.
 
The failures identified included:
 
a serious failure to adequately follow up a plan identified in an assessment undertaken on the 18th January 2022 by a First Response Team (FRT) Assessor and a Trainee Doctor.  The lack of any adequate follow up led directly to a failure to conduct a full Multi-Disciplinary Team Meeting (MDT) in respect of Jamie’s complex, on-going presentation involving increasing paranoia and psychotic-like symptomology in conjunction with on-going alcohol misuse;
 
a failure to undertake an urgent medication review over the same six-month period despite repeated requests for the same from GPs, Jamie himself and his mother;
 
the failure to hold a full MDT was a significant missed opportunity to allocate a Care Coordinator to Jamie and a missed opportunity to involve the Dual Diagnosis Service in Jamie’s care;
 
absent a full MDT and the allocation of a Care Coordinator, there was a serious missed opportunity to develop an appropriate Care Plan for Jamie and undertake regular, up-dated risk assessments regarding self-harm and suicide;
 
On the 20th May an EPUT Consultant Psychiatrist declined to undertake a review of Jamie’s medication, or any further form of review as requested by Jamie’s GP: this too was a serious missed opportunity.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
The accepted absence of effective formal, compulsory training for clinicians regarding the Dual Diagnosis (DD) pathway and what it does and does not provide, how to access it and the potential benefits of it. The evidence confirmed that practitioners outside of the DD workers/pathway were unaware how they could contact them, including directly.
 
In addition to weak record keeping and poor communication with patients and their families, the evidence revealed the lack of a robust and reliable system to ensure that the FRT deals with its caseload efficiently and effectively and particularly how it flags and then follows up referrals to and queries from other services/clinicians contributing, in turn and on the facts of this case, to the significant failure to hold an MDT.  The FRT did not follow up (as it was accepted it should have) the referral (via a self-referral) to Open Road or the referrals for a medication review.  Had there been such follow up, EPUT evidence confirmed that there would likely have been a discussion of Jamie’s case at a full MDT with the likely allocation of a Care Coordinator, the likely involvement of the Dual Diagnosis pathway and the likely use of the RAG rating system to ensure on-going risk assessment.
 
In my opinion these features give rise to a clear risk of future deaths and must be addressed.","On 20th June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jamie Harding, aged 31 years’. The investigation concluded at the end of a 5-day inquest on 12h April 2024. The medical cause of death was confirmed as:
 
I (a) Multiple severe Injuries
I (b) Fall from Height
 
II Psychotic Disorder
 
The Deceased had been under the care of the Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) Essex Support and Treatment for Early Psychosis (ESTEP) between 2017 and 2020 and he had been prescribed anti-psychotic medication and allocated a Care Coordinator. The inquest heard evidence that Jamie had engaged relatively well with his care plan and was reporting improvements in his symptoms. However, he began to disengage with services in 2019, which appears to have coincided with the replacement of his Care Coordinator. He was discharged from EPUT services in November 2020. Jamie’s GP continued to be prescribed anti-psychotic medication.
Two separate and urgent GP referrals were made to EPUT in November 2021 requesting an urgent review of Jamie, as he was hearing voices, experiencing paranoia, and reporting that his medication was not working. His mother also contacted EPUT directly.
On 18 January 2022, Jamie was assessed by EPUT’s First Response Team (FRT) via telephone. Jamie described his symptoms, reported that he was binge drinking, and requested different medication. A plan was put in please for Jamie to self-refer to a drug an alcohol service, and for his case to be discussed in a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting (‘MDT’). 
The evidence disclosed that in the six months that followed this assessment there were a series of significant and repeated failures on the part of EPUT employees, together with inadequacies in the systems of operation of EPUT’s First Response Team, in the care, management and treatment provided to Jamie.
 
My Narrative Conclusion recorded that the Deceased took his own life whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed and, further, recorded that a number of significant and repeated failures contributed to the avoidable death. The cumulative effect of these failures amounted to a gross failure to provide Jamie with basic medical care at a time that his condition clearly required it and, in this respect, neglect directly contributed to Jamie’s death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 23rd December 2024.

In late 2018 Chloe was investigated for symptoms indicative of cancer. In Late April 2029 she was admitted to hospital with upper right abdominal pain and an interrupted toilet habit. After diagnostic imaging, a preliminary diagnosis of colon cancer with metastases in the liver was arrived at.
 
Chloe was admitted into hospital awaiting a flexible sigmoidoscopy, planned for 8th May 2019.
 
Chloe’s pain increased; she was prescribed morphine. No recorded justification for the use of this powerful drug can be found in hospital records. The identity of one of the prescribing doctors cannot be made out due to the absence of clear records.
 
On the morning of 8th May 2019, she underwent an enema. Before and during this process, Chloe was observed to be unresponsive. It is Moments after the procedure a crash call was raised as Chloe had sustained a hypoxic cardiac arrest, contributed to by the use of morphine. It is possible that the un-consented enema process contributed to the cardiac arrest.

1. The Trust does not provide nursing cover during weekends and holiday periods of staff with relevant learning disability training.","On 17th November 2023, this court commenced an investigation into the death of Chloe Every, aged 27.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21st October 2024. The court returned a narrative conclusion.
 
Chloe Every died in hospital on 14th May 2019. Chloe’s death was caused by complications of a cardiac arrest sustained on 8th May 2019 whilst in hospital.
The cardiac arrest on 8th May was probably contributed to by treatment given to Chloe to manage symptoms of bowel cancer.
It is possible that medical procedures undertaken to facilitate diagnosis of Chloe’s cancer contributed to her death.
The inquest concluded that multiple actions and omissions of hospital staff during Chloe’s inpatient admission did not comply with local and national guidance. Some of those omissions were actions that would have resulted in contemporary evidence being created relevant to this inquest.
I find that there is insufficient contemporary evidence to allow me to undertake proper assessment of all of the factors that are likely to have contributed to Chloe’s death.”

1b Hypoxic Cardiac arrest, subsequent cardiogenic shock

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.  In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
I heard evidence that the prison authorities have already taken important steps, which I am satisfied address many of the concerns arising from Mark’s death. I am concerned however, that despite very strong evidence to the contrary, they maintained the risk assessments conducted on 2 and 3 July were reasonable in all the circumstances.
The supervising officer involved in the decision to close Mark’s ACCT on the morning of 3 July 2023, gave evidence that there was no likelihood Mark would commit further ACCTs of self-harm. While the inexperienced officer who later reopened the ACCT set Mark’s observations at one no more than two hours apart, relying in part on the fact that that is what they had been set at when the ACCT had been reopened the previous day. However, there had since been two significant risk incidents and the officer did not consult a supervising officer as required by PSI 64/2011. It is difficult to understand the prison’s position that these assessments were reasonable in all the circumstances.
Furthermore, on two occasions, the Head of Operations gave evidence that was incorrect and liable to mislead the jury and/or the coroner.
He gave evidence confirming the requirement for a person raising a concern under the ACCT process to consult with a supervising officer in respect of observation levels. He then added:
“I firmly believe that the supervising officers who gave evidence earlier this week, whether they recall it or not, would naturally have had that conversation, out of being inquisitive,
that would be my own personal view point but in terms of the prison stance, that’s what the policy says.”
When it was pointed out to him that that was not supported by either of the witnesses involved – who were both very clear that there had been no consultation – he apologised and suggested he had misunderstood.
I am troubled by the fact that the Head of Operations, instead of reflecting on the significance of that evidence in terms of learning lessons from Mark’s death, suggested to the jury that these witnesses must have been mistaken.
The second occasion concerned the issue of cell bell cover on the day of the event that caused Mark’s death.
Mark was housed on HB3 North. The Head of Operations gave evidence that it is normal for both HB3 North and HB3 South to have a single officer detailed to deal with cell bells over the lunch period. The officer on duty on 3 July was however very clear in his evidence that he was detailed to cover HB3S only. Every other prison witness asked about this agreed that there should be an officer covering each side of HB3 over lunch.
Curious and concerned as to how a member of the prison’s leadership team could have made such an error, I later recalled and asked the Head of Operations for an explanation. He could provide none. Although, he did later apologise for his difficulty answering other questions asked of him, explaining that he does not usually work in safer custody.",,,,,['https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-0577-Response-from-HMPPS.pdf']

1b Silicosis (Occupational lung disease)
 
Wessam had been working with artificial stone products which contain a very high percentage of Crystalline silica content.  The dust created when these products are cut, sanded and carved creates respirable crystalline silica (RCS) and is too fine to see with normal lighting.  It is recognised to cause silicosis if inhaled which causes a hardening or scarring of the lung tissue with initially no symptoms.
Once silicosis develops it is untreatable apart from offering lung transplantation.
 
The health risks are almost entirely preventable if exposure to dust is adequately controlled.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
This young man presented with an untreatable lung condition probably caused by exposure to RCS in his workplace.  This company, “Yes, Marble Ltd” is no longer trading.
 
Any current surveillance health and safety monitoring is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory outcome as the onset of untreatable disease predates the 15 year surveillance programmes.  In this case exposure appears to have commenced in May 2016 and he was diagnosed with silicosis in 2021, a mere 5 years after initial exposure.
Evidence from photographs and an in-life statement suggest Wessam was working in completely unsafe conditions to avoid dust exposure.
Australia has already taken the decision in 2024 to ban these artificial stone products.
There are a number of patients in the UK currently awaiting lung transplants due to RCS exposure from their workplaces.
 
The last 2 decades have seen rapid growth in the use of artificial stone and this death demonstrates the emergence of a severe progressive accelerated form of silicosis.  Many of the companies specialising in the finishing process of working with this product have a small number of employees and there appears to be an absence of safe working conditions, with no adequate water suppression systems for the dust created, in adequate respiratory personal protection equipment and absent or inadequate ventilatory systems.  This is therefore continuing to put the workforce at risk of death due to untreatable lung compromise.",,In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23rd December 2024.

The procedure was  complicated as she was found to have significant calcium build up in the coronary artery. It was  also noted that the left anterior descending artery had severe narrowing. Initially after the procedure she was pain free; however she began to experience further chest pain on 18/05/24  which was treated with medication. The chest pain recurred on 20/05/24 and a further procedure to insert a stent into the left anterior descending artery was undertaken on 21/05/24. During the  procedure access was difficult and significant calcification was noted. During ballooning the  coronary artery ruptured and was successfully treated with a stent. Whilst initially stable after the  procedure her condition deteriorated, and she presented with an unrecordable blood pressure. A  bedside echocardiogram confirmed a collection of blood around the heart and an emergency  pericardial aspiration was undertaken and she was taken back to the cardiac catheter lab where a  covered stent was fitted to try to treat the bleeding at the site of the previous perforation. The  bleeding was difficult to control and arrangements were made to transfer her to the Queen  Elizabeth Hospital where a CT scan confirmed bleeding in the abdomen. She was taken to theatre  where no site for bleeding was found in the abdomen; however a small perforation in the right  ventricle was identified and repaired which was likely caused when the emergency aspiration  procedure was undertaken. Sadly, she developed multi organ failure in the post operative period  and passed away on 25/05/24.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In May 2023 his liver function tests were noted to be significantly deranged with worsening jaundice and he was referred to the gastroenterology team at Homerton Hospital. He underwent non-invasive imaging (ultrasound elastography) on 22 November 2023 which was suggestive of underlying cirrhosis. Blood tests also identified that his bilirubin was high and his elastography was high, consistent with cirrhosis. It was confirmed that a liver biopsy was required to understand the likely cause of the liver disease.
 
Kingsley underwent a clotting screen on 27 November 2023 prior to the biopsy to check that his INR was below 1.4 so the procedure could take place, in accordance with Homerton Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust’s (“the Trust”) policy. Kingsley’s INR on this date was 1.3.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
1. There was no apparent liaison between the teams involved in Kingsley’s care to consider any matters that may be relevant to his HbSS prior to the biopsy being carried out;
2. The Trust’s Standard Operating Procedure (“SOP”) for Elective Liver Biopsy does not appear to give consideration to patients with other pathologies such as HbSS;
3. There was no apparent consideration given to potential additional post-operative monitoring or requirements for a patient with HbSS;
4. The Trust’s SOP refers to a document titled “Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British Society of Gastroenterology, the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Pathology” (Neuberger J, Patel J, Caldwell H et al. Gut 2020) which provides advice on liver biopsy techniques, methods and aftercare etc. These guidelines do not appear to give consideration (and therefore guidance) in relation to the use of liver biopsy for patients with other pathologies such as HbSS.","On 17 January 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of Kingsley Efosa Imafidon. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 October 2024. The medical cause of death was:
 
1a) Intra-abdominal haemorrhage
  b) Post liver biopsy for jaundice
  c) Liver cirrhosis
  d) —
II) Sickle cell disease
 
I recorded the following narrative conclusion:
 
Kingsley Efosa Imafidon had a medical history of homozygous sickle cell disease. On 29 November 2023, Mr Imafidon underwent a scheduled liver biopsy in order to investigate potential liver disease. Part of the device during the biopsy was deployed outside of the liver which later led to the procedural complication of bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, which led to Mr Imafidon’s death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [and/or your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by [DATE].

On the 11th March 2024 Nigel fell [REDACTED] at his home address.
 
An ambulance was called, and Nigel was initially taken to the Ipswich Hospital but was transferred to the trauma centre at Addenbrooke’s hospital due to the extent of his injuries.
 
Nigel succumbed to the injuries received in the fall, three days later.
 
Nigel had suffered with his mental health for a protracted period, and it is more likely than not that his fall from the window was a deliberate attempt to end his life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows.  –
 
1. In late 2018 Nigel became seriously mentally unwell and was admitted to a Mental Health Unit, under the Mental Health Act provisions, for a period of 3 months. Whilst admitted, Nigel was diagnosed with advanced lymphoma (a lymphatic cancer) and upon discharge from the Mental Health Unit spent a further 3 months in hospital being treated for this.
 
2. Nigel found his Mental Health Unit admission very traumatic and was described as ‘terrified’ of the thought of ever being admitted again.
 
3. Upon his release, his family, carers, Mental Health Home Treatment team, worked together to provide exemplary care for Nigel, whose health stabilised and in 2020 his care was transferred back to his own General Practitioner.
 
4. Nigel remained well until Friday 8th March 2024, when due to his decline in mental health he was taken to see his GP, and on the 9th March 2024 Nigel was prevented by family intervention from ending his life by jumping into a river.
 
5. This incident led to Nigel’s family speaking to the on duty Authorised Mental Health Professional (AMHP) from the Suffolk Emergency Duty Service Team, on the evening of 9th March 2024.  An AMHP is a mental health professional approved by a local social services authority to coordinate the mental health assessment and admission to hospital, of individuals requiring admission under the Mental Health Act provisions
 
6. In evidence, the court heard that the AMHP, in line with Nigel’s family and his own wishes, agreed that an admission to hospital would not be in Nigel’s best interest. The AMHP identified that the successful home treatment regime previously in place would be the ideal care package for Nigel. This arrangement would also be consistent with the ‘least restrictive principle’ which surrounds the application of Mental Health legislation.
 
7. That said, although Nigel did not meet the criteria for immediate admission, the AMHP believed Nigel was mentally very unwell, and in need of immediate support. The court heard that such support would be available within a 4-hour target time, from the emergency Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team.
 
8. However, the court was told that an AMHP, despite their role in the coordination of the mental health assessment and admission to hospital of a patient, were not permitted to make direct referrals to the emergency Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team.
 
9. The court heard that the normal route for such referrals was via the GP Surgery, or primary care Mental Health Nurse, neither of whom in Nigel’s case would have been available before 08:00 on Monday 11th March 2024. Nigel’s fall which led to his death, occurred at 06:25 that morning.","On 18th March 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of
 
Nigel Hutton HAMMOND
 
The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8th October 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of: –
 
Suicide, whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed.

It was described at the inquest that there was a sudden deterioration in Mr Eyre’s presentation  in spring 2022 and mention of a possible lymphoma. It was clear from all of the medical  evidence that the clinicians who were treating Mr Eyre thought that lymphoma was the most  likely cause of the deterioration in his health. It appears that potential diagnosis was only  excluded shortly before his death. 
  
During Mr Eyre’s deterioration it is apparent that tests were missed. It is also apparent that he  had neutropenic sepsis on more than one occasion. The inquest was not able to come to a  conclusion as to what was causing the neutropenic sepsis.   
  
As a result of Mr Eyre’s condition, he spent time as an inpatient at Medway Maritime Hospital.   
  
In October 2022, Mr Eyre was due to be discharged from hospital again to return to a custodial setting. The prison healthcare provider was adamant that his needs could not be met in the  custodial setting and was concerned that there were outstanding investigations to be  completed. A healthcare professional from the prison shared her concerns with staff in the  acute hospital. A junior doctor indicated that the concerns would be escalated to a Consultant  prior to discharge. That did not happen, instead, there was a telephone conference in which 
the prison healthcare staff were challenged as to their approach. The responsible Consultant  gave evidence at the inquest that she had not been made aware of the concerns of the prison  healthcare provider.   
  
Mr Eyre was returned to prison. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to hospital by 
ambulance having been found on the floor.   
  
In hospital, Mr Eyre’s health deteriorated and despite efforts at treatment, he died there on 20  November 2022. 
  
The record of inquest states: 
  
John Eyre was serving a custodial sentence at the time of his death, his health deteriorated in  2022 and he was treated for recurrent sepsis. The root cause of the sepsis was not identified.  On 31 October 2022, John was readmitted back to Medway Maritime Hospital as his health 
had deteriorated. Despite efforts as to ongoing investigations and treatment, John died at  Medway Maritime Hospital of pneumonia on 20 November 2022. At the time of John’s death 
he had liver disease which had not been identified.

I further heard evidence from the hospital trust on the need for a Regulation 28 report on 27th September 2024. 
The findings I made discussed the fact that despite Maeve having been tube fed on one occasion during admission this was not sufficient for her to recover. The inquest heard that provision of care for patients with severe ME such as that which Maeve suffered from was and is non-existent and that being placed on a ward that did not have expertise in her condition made her admission to hospital very difficult for her to endure. The conclusion of the inquest was Natural Causes and Box 3 recorded that she died at home after 3 admissions were unable to treat the consequences of her severe ME.
Maeve Boothby O’Neill was suffering from severe ME during the period the inquest focused on, namely January – October 2021.

Leighton Dickens died by incomplete atypical hanging alone in his home address on 14th October 2020.
 
The narrative conclusion which the Jury returned was:
 
Leighton Dickens died by hanging himself in circumstances where his intention could not be ascertained. It is the juries understanding, that it was a missed opportunity on the part of the police not to detain Leighton Dickens at hospital until he had been assessed by a Mental Health Professional.
 
 
The Inquest focused upon: –
 
a) Mr Dickens’ mental health condition and behaviour on the night of his death.
 
b) The fact that police officers came upon him by the side of the road in an undressed state in the presence of his partner who was trying to convey him to hospital.
 
c) His presentation and behaviour towards the officers before during and after arrival at hospital
 
d) The decision by officers not to invoke their powers under s. 136 Mental Health Act and to leave Mr Dickens at hospital in circumstances in which they knew that he had not been subject to medical assessment and intended to leave.
 
e) The limited sources of support available to assist or guide the officers.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
 
1) Following the withdrawal of the mental health triage support provided to the police by mental health nurses, the medically qualified sources of urgent support available to police officers to assist them to safeguard the public are limited to the mental health crisis teams.
 
2) The crisis teams may not be readily available and deal with their own case load.
 
3) The alternative support available from a mental health tactical adviser, is not provided by a clinically qualified member of staff and does not have access to the PARIS mental health records system.
 
4) The intended replacement of the mental health triage support was to have been by the “111 press 2” service.  This has not been put in to place and there is no current timescale for it to be put into place.",A Coronial investigation was commenced on 27th October 2020 into the death of Leighton Alan Dickens.  The Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted with a jury on 18th – 28th September 2023.

“On 28.12.23 Kelly Stevens, who lived with profound learning and physical disabilities, and received all nutrition, hydration and medication via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube, was admitted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital with abdominal distension and concern about her PEG tube. She was diagnosed with a likely pseudo-bowel obstruction and a plan was made for her to undergo endoscopic investigation. In the meantime, she was prescribed intravenous fluids but her intake of these was not properly recorded, and her electrolyte levels were not monitored. On the morning of 3.1.24 she suffered a seizure during which she aspirated some vomit. This seizure was caused by an excessively low sodium level which had not been recognized. She went on to develop aspiration pneumonia and, despite treatment, declined and died in hospital later that night.”","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
1.) Despite being under the care of the medical team, Ms. Stevens did also receive input from the surgical team. Her situation was further complicated by the fact that for most of her admission she was placed as a medical outlier on a surgical ward. In the event, no one consultant was in overall charge of her care, which meant that the issues identified in this case were not picked up on. I heard evidence that there was no policy in place at the Trust to give guidance as to how this sort of situation should be resolved, but instead that it was expected that consultants would liaise with each other in order to do so. That did not happen in this case;
2.) No doctor providing care for Ms. Stevens followed the established principle that the prescription of intravenous fluids for a patient must be accompanied by regular testing of electrolytes. In Ms. Stevens’ case, this was particularly important because her baseline sodium level was low anyway, so the over prescription of fluids put her at greater risk of hyponatraemia;
3.) There was no proper recording of Ms. Stevens’ fluid intake and output on fluid balance charts for most of her hospital admission. For the reasons set out at 2) above, this was vitally important in her case;
4.) Ms. Stevens’ hospital notes revealed evidence of the routine “copying and pasting” of out-of-date care plans by previous doctors. This meant that the next person reading her notes would be left with an erroneous view of her current care plan.","On 21 February 2024 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Kelly Marie STEVENS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 September 2024
 
The conclusion of the inquest was that Ms. Stevens “Died from complications associated with an excessively low, and unrecognized, sodium level while in hospital. Her death was contributed to by neglect.”","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, as the Chief Executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19 November 2024.

Systemic failure and Dennis’ death
 
2.   The court made findings of fact upon the wider circumstances, namely the 
systemic failure that was possibly causative of Dennis’ death. 
3.   On the day the ambulance call was made (20th December 2022) there were 
considerable ambulance delays. At approximately the time the ambulance call was made, 15:42 hours, there were between 13 and 18 ambulances waiting outside the Emergency Department (ED) at Royal Cornwall Hospital (RCHT). 
4.   At approximately 08:00 on 21st December when Dennis arrived at ED there were  56 patients in the ED and 11 ambulances waiting outside the ED. The ED is built to
house 44 patients. 
5.   In December 2022, the total amount of time waiting for beds or transport after 
decisions to discharge from ED totalled 20,144 hours which is the equivalent of 27  cubicles being closed to ED.  This amounts to more than half the available space 
in ED taken throughout December 2022 by patients waiting for beds to become  available on acute wards or for discharge for alternative care arrangements. 
6.   The court found that the hospital regularly failed to meet the 4-hour target for  moving patients out of ED at the time of Dennis’ death and since.  It was noted that
there is a recent major study which shows that the standardised mortality rate  starts to rise from 5 hours after the patient’s time of arrival at the ED and they  concluded that after 6–8 hours, there is one extra death for every 82 patients 
delayed. 
7.   The court found insufficient bed availability on acute wards which was attributed to 
an increase in patients with no reason to reside (NCTR), these being patients who  are medically optimised but cannot be discharged due to lack of onward care  support. 
8.   Approximately 80% of NCTR patients are of that status for external reasons  beyond the control of RCHT.  The main causes of external NCTR numbers were 
found to be as follows: 
Social care provision (whether commissioned by social services or NHS) 
namely packages of care in the community, beds in nursing homes or  residential care homes  
NHS primary healthcare support for discharge (in the home) 
NHS community hospital provision 
9.   On the day of Dennis’ 999 call 20 December 2022 the externally delayed NCTR 
was approximately 120 patients. This is over 20% of RCHT bed capacity. 
10. The court found significant correlation between delayed discharges, handover 
delays and delays in response times. On this basis, the court found there was a  direct connection between the ambulance delay experienced by Dennis and inadequate social care provision, community hospital provision and primary  healthcare support leading to delayed discharges from hospital. 
11. The connection between delayed discharges and ambulance delays and the
associated risks has been referred to in reports from Southwest Ambulance  Service Trust (SWAST) and the Health Services Safety Investigations Body  (HSSIB). The court found that the state knew or ought to know of the risks.  
Current circumstances of systemic failure
12. The findings of fact upon current circumstances in relation to the systemic failure 
were as follows. 
13. There was found to be a direct connection between current ambulance delays and 
inadequate social care provision, community hospital provision and primary  healthcare support on discharge. This is because inadequacies in those services  lead to delayed discharges from hospital which lead to shortages of acute beds,  impeded patient flow, crowding in ED and the inability of ambulances to handover  patients to ED. 
14. Significant average handover delays at RCHT were recorded for every month of 
2024. This is a picture reflected across the SW and indeed nationally.  
15. The average handover delays conceal spikes such as that which led to the long 
delay as in this case. Such long delays increase the risk of mortality.   
16. There are continuing delays of patients from ED which is evidenced by the ongoing
failure to regularly meet the 4-hour standard.  These delays increase the risk of  mortality. 
17. Over the last year up to 16% of patients in RCHT have been of external NCTR  status, patients who meet the criteria for discharge but cannot be discharged for 
reasons external to RCHT. 
18. The court found that if the external NCTR numbers could be reduced, this would 
significantly address current issues of ambulance delays, ED crowding, and the  shortage of acute beds.  
19. The main drivers of external NCTR patients are inadequate social care provision, 
community hospital provision and primary healthcare support on discharge.  20. Approximately 10% of social care posts in Cornwall are currently vacant 
notwithstanding Cornwall Council securing the agreement of social care providers  to pay the living wage.  This reflects the national picture of 165,000 vacant social  care posts.  
21. The NHS and Cornwall Council generally do not employ social care staff and rely 
upon social care providers.  
22. In connection with care homes there are no Cornwall Council owned care homes, 
the Council does not directly run any homes and does not plan to build any new  care homes. 
23. The Council does have a ‘’…development framework which will support local and 
national developers to build new care homes in Cornwall.’’ 
24. The extent of the obligation on local authorities is set out in the Care Act s5 
A local authority must promote the efficient and effective operation of a  market in services for meeting care and support needs with a view to  ensuring [inter alia] …. a variety of high quality services to choose from… 
25. The NHS does not carry responsibility for the recruitment and retention of social 
care staff or any broad obligation to promote the social care market. 
26. The organisations immediately required to deal with ambulance delays are 
ambulance trusts and acute hospitals, In Cornwall that is SWAST and RCHT.  These organisations do not have control over the services primarily responsible for  ambulance delays, namely social care provision, primary healthcare provision and  community hospital provision. They are unable to influence the whole-system and  therefore carry risks that they cannot wholly mitigate or manage. 
27. The court noted the HSSIB report which states that delayed discharges (and  consequent ambulance delays) are a national issue which is attributed to a whole 
system failure of health and social care. The court noted the HSSIB investigation’s  first safety recommendation is an urgent ‘whole system’ response to reduce patient harm.",,,,,,['https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-0508-Response-from-DHSC.pdf']

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
The lift that trapped Mr Nazemi and the attending paramedics is identified in an e-Worksheet generated by Schindler (copy attached) as a 20049625 MOD Replacement 6300.
 
The lift was examined by Schindler on the day of the incident, and it was found that “the uncontrolled movement device had been activated by persons using the lift”. The lift was being used by four paramedics who were transporting Mr Nazemi in a carry chair, the lift being too small to accommodate a stretcher. None of the paramedics were aware of having activated the uncontrolled movement device.
 
The evidence suggested that that was no way to reset the uncontrolled movement device once it had been activated, and that a call to the 24/7 helpline displayed in the lift could not help. Ultimately those trapped within the lift had to wait for the Fire & Rescue Service to break the lift door down.","On 25/01/2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ali Mohammed Nazemi, aged 53. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 17/09/2024.

Family members had noticed a decline in his mobility and responsiveness. He had a significant previous medical history which included rheumatoid arthritis, an active stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage diagnosed in March 2023. He suffered various falls resulting from that condition over the last year. He had previously attended Stepping Hill with what appeared to be a seizure in August 2023 and had been referred to a Neurologist who tested for motor neurone disease, which was negative. He was due an MRI scan to rule out causes for his confusion at the point at which he was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital.
The complaint on admission was lethargy and bruise to the right side of the head following
a fall at home. A CT scan revealed a bilateral new subdural collection due to a malignant process. Given the diagnosis of a bleed the expectation was that it would stop, and it did.
His confusion improved. Consequently, in March 2024 he was thought to be optimised for discharge. He did not see a doctor immediately prior to discharge. The records incorrectly indicated that Mr Daniels was completely mobile despite telephone reports to the family that he was deteriorating. He was sent home by ambulance on 6 March 2024 due to being unfit to be transported by car. He was clearly unwell and returned by ambulance to Macclesfield Hospital on 9 March 2024 where a CT scan revealed an acute on chronic subdural bleed. He was transferred to Salford Hospital into the care of the neurosurgical team. His condition was not survivable at any point from 26 January 2024 and he sadly passed away on 21 March 2024.
His condition fluctuated in keeping with a rare diagnosis of intracranial hypotension which was not known until a specialist neuroradiologist independently reviewed the scans at Stepping Hill following his death.",During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence Mr Sanghera was deemed to be suffering from behavioural issues rather than a mental health crisis and no full Mental Health Act assessment took place either at New Cross Hospital or whilst in custody at Oldbury Police station. 
 
The risk assessments performed in hospital and police custody identified no concerns of risk of suicide or self-harm from release.  However, evidence at the inquest showed that he was suffering from a mental health crisis at the time.
 
My concern is that given the erratic behaviour he was displaying and his vulnerability, further consideration should have been given for a full mental health act assessment to take place before release.  Therefore, you may wish to consider reviewing the arrangements and assessments required before discharge from hospital or being released from custody.","On 26 March 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Parminder Singh Sanghera born on the 7 July 1980 who died on the 13 February 2023.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 July 2024.
 
The inquest was heard before myself sitting without a Jury and my conclusion at inquest was one of Suicide.

“On 11.9.23 Alfred Sparrow, who lived with vascular dementia, became a resident at The Meadows Nursing Home, Catshill, Bromsgrove. During his time there, his oral intake of food and fluids would fluctuate, and he gradually became more frail. At the end of November 2023 his condition deteriorated significantly, and he declined and died there on the evening of 1.12.23.”","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
1) Mr. Sparrow had a longstanding diagnosis of vascular dementia, and his care plan stated that he required full assistance and support from staff at mealtimes with regard to his intake of food and fluids, and that he would not support himself if food and drink was placed in front of him. Despite the care plan, entries in Mr. Sparrow’s care notes, while recording his food and fluid intake, made no mention of whether a staff member at The Meadows Nursing Home was assisting him in this regard. Having heard evidence at the inquest, I was satisfied, and found as a matter of fact, that staff at The Meadows Nursing Home did not always assist Mr. Sparrow with his food and fluid intake;","On 12 December 2023 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Alfred Edward SPARROW. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 August 2024.
 
The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr. Sparrow “died from natural causes.”","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, as the Chief Executive Officer of Cardinal Healthcare, which runs The Meadows Nursing Home, have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 1 October 2024.

Two admissions at Southampton General Hospital followed from 18 February 2022 to 31 March 2022 and from 14 April 2022 until her death on 31 August 2022 and a short admission to Romsey Rehabilitation hospital during the intervening period from 31 March 2022 to 14 April 2022 when Janet Karen HARRISON was deemed to be medically optimised.  During her first admission in the hospital she acquired deep vein thrombosis and hospital acquired pneumonia for which she was treated. In her second admission to Southampton General Hospital, she suffered from a bacterial infection and a gastrointestinal bleed for which she was treated. She continued to show signs of an infection in June and July 2022 and was treated for cholecystitis. She also suffered from left gluteal haematoma for which she was treated surgically on 8 August 2022 and 27 August 2022 due to ongoing concerns of infection.  She died on 31 August 2022 from hospital acquired pneumonia.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
A) At 22.26pm Hampshire Constabulary’s control room received an automated telephone call from the deceased’s iPhone indicating that the deceased had been in a serious car crash and was not responding to their iPhone.  The operator logged “no direct request made and cannot hear anything distinctive in the background – no sounds of distress/disturbance”.  An accurate location was provided by the iPhone. 
B) The iPhone was called back, but the call went straight to voicemail.
C) The control room supervisor forwarded the message to the intelligence team to establish who the iPhone belonged to and whether there was any serious harm or risk to life at that time.
D) By 22.43 the intelligence team had drawn a blank.  But for a separate telephone call from a member of the public at 22.45, further steps may have been made to make contact (one of which, an “Icetrak” message which was sent to the iPhone at 22.59 asking whether there was an emergency and requesting  a 999 call if so)  or a Police vehicle may have been assigned to attend the GPS co-ordinates provided by the iPhone or no further action taken.
E) The evidence indicated that false alarms from electronic devices such as telephones and watches are commonplace, and that locations received from such devices was often inaccurate and liable to involve substantial Police time in tracking the device down. 
F) The Apple serious car crash detection automatic calls were a recent development at the time of the index accident.  Other manufacturers have launched a similar feature. The investigating officer stated during the inquest that “not enough is known (by the police) about this technology within people’s personal phones.” 
G) I am concerned that the understanding, training and procedures need review to assist with appropriately prompt response in situations where there is an indication of a collision where a risk to life may exist.","On 01 June 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of George Robert DILLON aged 19.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 April 2024.  The conclusion of the inquest was that:

This was found by chance following a cardiac arrest. As a result of that diagnosis he required a permanent tracheotomy whilst there were investigations undertaken about the best course of treatment for him.
 
Lee was assessed as able to leave hospital with a tracheotomy whilst those investigations were undertaken. He attended an outpatient appointment on 7 December 2021 and there were no obvious signs of difficulties with his tracheotomy. He required further scans to look for metastases and see whether the treatment the MDT would recommend would be surgical or chemotherapy/radiotherapy.
 
On 10 December 2021 Lee underwent an MRI scan which did pick up an incidental finding of potential emphysema which was not reported. The MRI scan is not the optimal test for picking this up and that was not the purpose of the MRI scan but the potential presence of emphysema on 10th is relevant to later actions.
 
On 14 December 2021 Lee had a PET scan. This scan definitively picked up the presence of emphysema and reported that this was likely as a result of the displaced tracheotomy tube. This scan was reported on the 15 December 2021 and the secretaries at Barnsley Hospital ENT team were contacted by the caseworker from Alliance Medical to notify them that there was a report being sent with a critical finding on. There were delays in the caseworker being identified within Alliance Medical to report the scan to the hospital.
 
When the email was sent from Alliance Medical to the hospital it was not flagged as urgent however the subject line did state ‘Critical findings’. The first email did not attach the report and the secretary had to ring Alliance Medical back to request the report which was sent a short time later. This was sent to the Consultant who had given Lee his initial diagnosis.
Also on 15 December 2021 Lee began to feel unwell and contact his GP who believed that Lee had a chest infection following a telephone consultation and prescribed antibiotics. He stated that he had a low level of suspicion for the chest infection but did not feel it was necessary to see Lee. He stated that he did not know about that Lee had a tracheotomy although this is recorded within the clinical notes.
 
The Consultant at Barnsley hospital was aware of the critical findings on the scan on 15 December 2021. His initial view was that Lee should not have been allowed to leave hospital or that this was a false positive result. He asked that the nurse, [REDACTED] try to ascertain where Lee was and sent her a text requesting her to do this. His view in evidence was that he believed this was a false positive rather than a displaced tube. However the text which was sent states:- ‘Sorry to trouble you. It appears on PET that Mr Dryden’s tube is not in the trachea. Apparently he was allowed to walk off the premises at NGH. Could you contact him to make sure he is o.K. And encourage him to come in for a review/Re-siting Regards.’ This text was sent at 17:49 on 15 December and was not picked up until 09:16 on 16 December 2021.
 
There was therefore no contact made with Lee after the scan findings.
 
Late on 15 December 2021 Lee’s mum became so concerned about him that she rang for an ambulance. The ambulance grading was a grade 2 which has an expected response time of 18 minutes with a second target of 9 in 10 grade two calls being responded to in 40 minutes. Lee’s call was responded to in 2 hours and 26 minutes. This was due to pressures on the service at the time.
 
This meant that Lee presented at hospital on 16 December 2021 at 00:57 and was very unwell and required treatment for a cardiac arrest. Unfortunately they were unable to ventilate Lee through the tracheotomy as it was not ventilating properly and therefore an additional tube needed to be placed. As a result of the cardiac arrest Lee suffered with a hypoxic brain injury which was ultimately the cause of his death.
 
The failure to take additional steps to contact Lee following the critical findings in the scan on the 15 December 2021 amounts to a gross failure of basic care. Once the findings were known to the consultant body, who clearly felt that Lee required eyes on checking at that time is a basic and ongoing failure which is very very significant.
 
In relation to whether the failure to contact Lee following the scan results being known by the Trust on the 15 December 2021 was causative or contributory to Lee’s death in a way that was more than minimally negligibly or trivially. Lee had evidence of emphysema on the MRI scan on 10 December 2021. This was confirmed and attributed to the misplacement of the tube on the 15 December 2021. Lee had therefore potentially managed with the misplaced tube and no ill effects for a number of days. It is apparent to me, on the basis of the evidence that the turning point for Lee was the 15th and 16th December 2021.
 
Had sufficient attempts been made to contact Lee after the scan results were known on the 15th of December 2021 he would have been seen in hospital prior to the cardiac arrest which resulted in the hypoxic brain injury. Although death did not occur for some time after the cardiac arrest, the fatal event was effectively the cardiac arrest on the 16 December 2021.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
1. There is Royal College Guidance as to how and by what means the images are reported from external organisations such as Medical Alliance to NHS Trusts however this appears to not be understood or embedded by NHS Trusts.","On 24 January 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lee Dryden born on 1 January 1978. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was:-
 
Narrative Conclusion: On 16th December 2021 Lee Dryden was admitted to hospital and suffered from a cardiac arrest. This resulted in a hypoxic brain injury and his death on 12th January 2022. Prior to the cardiac arrest it was apparent on the 15th that his tracheotomy tube was misplaced however this was not actioned before his cardiac arrest on 16th December 2021. His death was contributed to by neglect.
 
The medical cause of death was:
 
1a: Hypoxic brain injury
1b: Cardiac arrest
1c: Displacement of tracheotomy tube
2: Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27 September 2023.

The care plan for June identified that she was bed bound (to be moved to and from her bed only using a hoist) and that she required two hourly turns to avoid pressure areas.
 
On 29 May 2022, June was incorrectly moved to and from her bed without the use of a hoist for the purposes of being weighed.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
 
There was a failure to record the injury from the body map in the daily communication records both on 3rd June and 6th June, and a failure to pass that information on at handover (or to document that the information had been passed on). This led to a period in which June was being turned on a 2 hourly basis with a displaced femur fracture.
 
There was a failure to recognise that medical attention was required for June from at least 3rd June 2022, notwithstanding all personal care being conducted by the healthcare assistants. 
 
There was a failure to follow the care plan by the healthcare assistants. There has been no investigation done to identify whether this is a condoned or common practice within the home.","On 11 July 2022 an investigation was commences into the death of June Peel born on 28 June 1933. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative one and read:-
 
June Peel died at Barnsley District General Hospital on 22nd June 2022 following an admission from Belle Green Court Care Home. She presented at hospital a displaced fracture to her left distal femur as the result of an unidentified fall. The displaced fracture had been present since at least 3rd June 2022. June’s admission to hospital on 8th June 2022 followed a missed opportunity to seek earlier medical attention, and a delay in examining, diagnosing, and treating the injury. June underwent an open reduction and internal fixation during which there were complications contributed to by the formation of a callus. June did not recover from the operation and sadly died on a palliative care pathway.

His GP referred him into mental health services for assessment however when the services made contact with the home he was residing in Mark was not present at the home.

Despite this being brought to the attention of staff multiple times, the staff at the Jessops Wing refused to accept that Mojeri’s mother was providing them with the correct information.
 
Mojeri’s mother went into labour and due to the policy, guided by national practice, no life saving support was offered to Mojeri because he was under 22 weeks gestation.

Unfortunately, the information which the hospital held about Mojeri’s gestational age was incorrect and at the time of the premature labour he was just over the 22 weeks gestation mark.
 
I was told in evidence that the single biggest feature in Mojeri’s death was the much earlier premature rupture of membranes at 17 weeks gestation and that even if the correct gestational age had been known there would not have been different treatment offered.

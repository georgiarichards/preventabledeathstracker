In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The following matters of concern are directed to Sodexo for response –
 
It is important to note that at the time of Kane’s death, the prison was managed by Serco Ltd under a contract awarded by HMPPS. Since Kane’s death, the contract for managing the prison has been awarded to Sodexo. Sodexo were invited to submit learning evidence to the court, if such existed, but instead said they would respond to any prevention of future death report I felt was necessary.
 
A number of the prison staff involved in Kane’s care in October 2021 continue to work at the prison and were unaware of local policy in relation to the matters below as of present times.
 
Having received no formal evidence of any changes made at HMP Lowdham Grange, and staff having failed to report any evidence of changes, I highlight the following concerns –
 
1. Ignoring Cell Bells
I heard evidence that staff were engaging in the deliberate ignoring of prisoner cell bells. I have seen no local policy which either prohibits such activity, or, if such activity is permitted, supports staff to make risk-based considerations about how and when to ignore cell bells.
 
I observe that deliberately ignoring cell bells appears to be a wholly dangerous practice as the cell bell is the only method of communication between prisoner and staff during periods of lock up, including night state. The practice appears to be all the more dangerous when one considers some staff suspected Kane to be in a state of heightened emotion and acting under the influence of alcohol.
 
Isolating power to cells
As above, I have seen no policy which supports the isolation of power to cells including who has the power to make such a decision, how long the power should be isolated for, and whether staff are required to consider any risk factors when determining whether to isolate power to the cell.
 
Failure to follow the local Under the Influence Policy
Three members of staff suspected Kane was under the influence of something in the hours before his death, yet none opened an under the influence log or sought any medical advice about how frequently to check on him, what signs of deterioration to look out for, and when to seek further assistance.
 
Lack of understanding of Prison Service Instruction 64/2011, and possible discord between local policy and the PSI
A number of prison officers believed Kane’s birthday was incapable of amounting to a “key date or anniversary” for the purposes of PSI 64/2011. It seems to me to be common sense that a birthday, being the anniversary of one’s birth, could amount to a potential trigger date for heightened emotions which considering a prisoner’s risk of self harm and suicide. That is not to say it would be so for each and every prisoner, but perhaps something to be cognisant of when dealing with an emotional and intoxicated prisoner. I have seen no evidence that this is covered in Sodexo’s training for staff on the ACCT process, if indeed any series of training exists.
 
A number of prison officers gave evidence that an ACCT was not necessary because Kane had not said to anyone that he was going to harm himself (either fatally or otherwise). Serco’s Safer Prison Operating Policy (August 2022) is confusing on this point and seems to suggest at paragraph 3.4 that staff should only open an ACCT when a statement of self-harm has been verbalised. This is not consistent with the PSI. Sodexo have not offered for scrutiny any local policy, guidance or training material on the threshold for opening an ACCT, but even if such exists, it appears some staff continue to labour under the misapprehension that a prisoner must say they are thinking of harming themselves before an ACCT can be opened.
 
A failure to implement learning from the investigations that follow deaths in custody
Many of the staff giving evidence explained that they had not read the PPO report, nor were they aware of the issues identified by the PPO prior to giving evidence at the inquest. I have seen no evidence of the systems in place at HMP Lowdham Grange to seek to learn from deaths in custody at the earliest opportunity.
 
The following matters of concern are addressed to The Minister for Prisons and Probation, HMPPS –
 
Poor Quality Early Learning Review process, November 2021
While it is recognised that the ELR process is designed to capture information at a very early stage of the investigation, it is nevertheless an important tool in seeking to identify safety issues that should be addressed swiftly in order to prevent future deaths.
 
The central issue in this case was obvious from the outset, as recorded in various intelligence reports submitted by staff on the night of the death, namely, a number of members of staff suspected Kane to be under the influence of alcohol yet failed to take the necessary steps to seek to safeguard against harm.
 
On page 4 of the ELR it is concluded that “all procedures were followed” and there were no local or national recommendations for learning lessons. It is difficult to rationalise this conclusion against the evidence available even at the earliest stages of the investigation. The author was clearly aware that staff had considered Kane to be under the influence of alcohol (see page 1) and should have been aware that no Under the Influence Log existed. The author simply notes that “the policy has been reviewed”. There is no explanation as to why the policy wasn’t followed. Was the policy unclear in its requirements? Was there an absence of staff training on the policy? Of great concern to me is the fact that staff giving evidence at the inquest still seemed to fail to grasp the significance of intoxication as a risk factor for self-harm.
 
My concerns extend beyond the quality of the report, but also to the accuracy of the same.
 
The report is written in such a way as to create the impression that the author interviewed key members of staff. Comments are attributed to staff at particular points in time, yet all prison staff witnesses denied ever having been interviewed as part of the ELR process. It is unclear exactly what methodology the author has used during the investigation. I am concerned that the quality of the investigation has led to missed opportunities to have identified these issues at the outset.
 
7. A Lack of Candour – both organisationally and individually
I would be very interested to understand how the duty of candour applies to the prison service and those individuals within the employ of the service (whether employed directly or through a private provider, as in this case).
 
There is a statutory duty of candour applicable to healthcare organisations and professionals, as well as a more recent agreement by the College of Policing for members to adhere to a Code of Candour.
 
In practise, candour creates a culture of being open and honest with all stakeholders by accepting when things go wrong, taking remedial steps as soon as practicable, and thus reducing the risk of events repeating themselves. In the context of a death, candour from the outset is essential in order to support the bereaved family.
 
The position adopted by Serco in this inquest, as it has in other inquests, could be said to represent the very opposite of candour. Having heard evidence supplied on Oath by their own staff members that there were multiple failures to open an under the influence log (evidence which was not contested) the organisation nevertheless required the Jury to return a finding on this issue, and each and every issue, instead of a factual finding being presented to the jury as agreed by all Interested Persons.
 
The inquest is not an adversarial process, there is no burden of proof. The Interested Persons are under a duty to assist the investigative process in an open and honest manner by identifying those issues that genuinely require determination by the jury, and those on which there is agreement. Sadly, in my extensive experience of conducting Article 2 inquests locally, this is not an isolated example of the uncomfortable position adopted by the prison service in failing to put forward sensible and reasonable factual admissions of shortcomings.
 
I am concerned by the apparent absence of a culture of candour supporting those staff who work within the prison service. Many of the staff members giving evidence explained that the inquest was the first time it had been suggested to them that they had not adhered to policy. In the intervening period of over two years between Kane’s death and the inquest, no-one at the prison had asked key staff to reflect on the care they provided to Kane that night and consider areas of learning. Again, this is not a position unique to this inquest, and is of great concern in the context of a rising number of self-inflicted prisoner deaths at HMP Lowdham Grange since Kane’s tragic death in 2021.
 
I would be grateful if your response could address what steps have been, or are being taken, to ensure that candour is applied throughout the death in custody process.","Kane Christopher Boyce died by ligature asphyxiation on 3 October 2021, at HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, where he was detained as a serving prisoner.

She had ischaemic and hypertensive heart disease and developed a large sacral sore with associated sepsis. These conditions precipitated congestive cardiac failure. She was admitted to Tameside General Hospital on 19th May 2023 where despite treatment, she died the same day of Sepsis with congestive cardiac failure.
 
The inquest heard that Mrs Roberts was supported by care agency carers four times per day and the District Nursing Team. Following a Tissue Viability assessment on 20th April 2023 the frequency of visits by the District Nursing team was increased to daily until Mrs Roberts was admitted to Tameside General Hospital on 19th May 2023.
 
The Inquest heard that the care agency raised concerns with Adult Social Care because her dressings were not being changed daily. In addition, Mrs Robert’s family raised concerns as did the hospital nurse responsible for Mrs Robert’s care on 19th May 2023. As a result, an investigation was opened by the District Nursing Service.
 
The Inquest heard that insufficient dressing changes for a sacral sore can lead to localised and systemic infection due to the risk of a sore in that area of the body being contaminated with urine and faeces.
 
The family were told on several occasions that the nursing team did not have time to change dressings. On 17th May 2023 a nurse did not attend to care for Mrs Roberts due to demands upon the District Nursing Team. The team offered instead an out of hours visit that would have disturbed Mrs Roberts and her family from sleep and so this was not accepted.
 
The Inquest heard that there are ongoing staffing issues within the District Nursing Team.
 
Following the Serious Incident Investigation, a number of measures have been undertaken by the Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust to address issues identified with the care of Mrs Roberts and with the district nursing service generally including:
 
Introduction of weekly compliance checks for Waterlow, MUST and body mapping policies.
All District Nursing Visits deferred to the out of hours service must be approved by Sister of Team leader.
 
However, the Inquest heard that despite a number of steps taken locally to manage the District Nursing Service such as using a variety of different staffing grades for visits, staffing shortages cannot be rectified by local action without a change of approach nationally.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
During the Inquest evidence was heard that:
 
Sam’s mother died by an act of self-harm on the 12th April 2014. Sam was greatly affected by his mother’s death which was  known by the prison and healthcare staff at HMP Portland, however the date of her death was not identified in the prison or healthcare records and was not known to those caring for Sam.
 
Had both prison and healthcare staff been aware of the date they would have spoken to Sam around this time to provide support to him.
 
Prisons nationally use a records system called NOMIS and healthcare providers in prisons nationally use a records system called SystmOne. There is no mechanism in NOMIS or SystmOne to highlight key or trigger dates that may have an impact upon a prisoner.
 
Following the evidence at this Inquest, local processes have been immediately put into place at HMP Portland to ensure that prisoners will be asked about any significant or trigger dates at the initial and second healthcare screen when they arrive at the prison. This information will be recorded on SystmOne manually in the risk information box and a task will be scheduled close to the key date. Prison staff do not have access to SystmOne. This is a local process and not a national one and this issue is likely to arise at all prisons in England and Wales.
 
There is no national guidance or policy on this and no specific question on the SystmOne records, or location in the NOMIS records, to enquire into, or highlight, significant dates for the prisoner.
 
When meeting with a prisoner, prison staff have access to the NOMIS records, however, most of the prison staff who gave evidence at the Inquest stated that they would not read the full records and just look at the last 2 or 3 contacts. Due to the current reduction in staffing levels at HMP Portland as a result of difficulties in recruitment, which is affecting  staffing  within prisons nationally, staff gave evidence that they do not have the time to consider the NOMIS records in full for routine checks or welfare checks under the keyworker scheme. Evidence was also given by a Supervising Officer at the prison that when ACCT reviews are conducted this could be the first time they meet the prisoner and they do not have time to go through all the records due to current staffing pressures.
 
There is no ability to search the NOMIS records by a key word search as there is on SystmOne, so key information about a prisoner may be buried within the case notes section on NOMIS which can be very lengthy. To find out this  information  staff would have to go through all the records  which as stated above is not practically possible due to current staffing levels. As  a result information can be missed.
 
Although there is an alerts page on NOMIS this only allows certain standard entries and there is no free text box to allow bespoke entry of information. This results in key  information about a prisoner being overlooked. Some witnesses gave evidence that they were not aware of Sam’s history contained in the NOMIS records and had they been, they would have acted differently.
 
There is a new version of NOMIS which although being used in the Prison Service at the moment, is still under development which could address these issues.
 
iii. In prison, prisoners  are  prescribed  medication  to  take  either under supervision or in their own possession. This means that a prisoner can self-medicate in their cell. Prescriptions of medications can be given to cover a supply for up to 28 days. Prior to a determination as to whether it would be safe for a prisoner to have medication in their possession, a  risk assessment is undertaken both around the type of medication and the prisoner’s individual risks.
 
Sam was prescribed [REDACTED] and was permitted to take this in possession for a period of 7 days. He last collected this on 26th January 2021, over 3 months before his death. Following his death, he was  found to have [REDACTED] in his blood and [REDACTED]  was found in his cell.
It may have been that he was illicitly obtaining [REDACTED],
however it may also be that he had left over  medication  from that he had been prescribed previously.
 
When a prisoner stops taking medication, healthcare teams have little option other than asking if a person has any leftover medication and are dependent on the prisoner handing any excess medication back. Healthcare teams do not have the power to search a cell although can pass information on to the prison staff if they have any concerns regarding the stockpiling  or access to medication in the cell.
 
There is a local operating policy in place within the healthcare department at HMP Portland to cover medication. Following the evidence heard during the Inquest, this has already been amended to ensure steps are taken to try to ensure that a prisoner does not have any medication in their cell which they should not have. There is, however, no national guidance  to assist both healthcare and Prison Service staff deal with this issue and it is for individual risons to set u their own recesses.","On the 11th May 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death  of Samuel Lewis Jones, born on the 24th November 1998.   ",In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, 30th January 2024.

Julia was 89 years of age at the time if her death.
 
On 06/04/2023 Julia suffered a fall in the care home where she resided, she was admitted to hospital, however, she was too unwell for surgery to the fracture she had sustained when she fell. Notwithstanding all appropriate care and treatment in hospital Julia’s condition deteriorated culminating in her death.
 
From the time Julia was resident in the care home she suffered 21 falls, the first being on 15/01/2022 and the last being on 06/04/2023. The final fall when Julia sustained a fracture to her hip caused her death.
 
During her stay in the care home only 3 referrals were made for advice from the specialist falls prevention team, the first on 30/09/2022, the second on 24/11/2022 the day after her 13th fall on 23/11/2023, it is worthy of note, there was no response from the falls prevention referral on the first occasion and a second referral was not made until Julia had fallen again.
 
A physiotherapist assessed Julia on 10/01/2023 and recommended the use of a zimmer frame, on 19/01/2023 the falls prevention team recommend Julia should use a zimmer frame, a falls sensor mat, a crash mat and they also recommended Julia should be encouraged to come out of her room during the day. A crash mat was deemed inappropriate.
 
The third referral to the falls team was made on 10/03/2023, this referral stated ……. “Sheila has had 18 falls since 01/01/2022”. Julia had suffered four falls over the 5th & 6th March 2023.
 
The first referral form (reason for referral box, on page 1) stated “struggling to walk even short distances and is holding to everything when walking. It might be better with a Zimmer frame or something similar to that”. There was no mention in the reason for referral box of Julia’s falls history even though at the time she had fallen 12 times when that fall occurred.
 
The referral form dated 24/11/2022, (reason for referral box) stated “had a few falls since January this year, sensor mat is in place and OT referral was sent on 30/09/22 and that has been chased up today 24/11/2022”. By the 24/11/2022 Julia had fallen 13 times.
 
The first referral, in the reasons for referral box did not describe the fact that Julia had suffered 12 falls, as it should have done, and it was not followed up as it should have been until the day after she had fallen on 23/11/2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She presented with a headache and vomiting which had started two days previously. She was prescribed antibiotics for a suspected infection. It is probable that the symptoms were due to a subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a burst aneurysm. A hospital referral at this point would probably have identified the subarachnoid haemorrhage and allowed preventative treatment to reduce the risk of her developing severe vasospasm. On 2nd April 2023 an ambulance was called as she was feeling unwell. The ambulance crew did not recognise that her behaviour was inconsistent with her usual presentation. She was taken to Tameside General Hospital where there was a prolonged wait to be seen. A CT scan undertaken showed evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage that had occurred previously around 28th March 2023. The scan was incorrectly reported as being clear. At Tameside General Hospital her consciousness levels were reduced, and she was agitated. She had probably developed a severe vasospasm from the subarachnoid haemorrhage. Treatment options at this point are extremely limited. An MRI scan on 5th April 2023 showed multi territorial infarctions and significant narrowing of all the intracranial vessels. On the balance of probabilities, the neurological situation was probably irreversible on her admission to Tameside General Hospital. She was transferred to Salford Royal Hospital where attempts to treat her were unsuccessful. She died at Salford Royal Hospital on 11th April 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The inquest heard evidence that early identification of a burst aneurysm is vital if treatment is to be offered at an early enough stage to reduce the risk of death.
The inquest was told that particularly in primary care the symptoms are not readily understood and awareness is often low. In Kirsty Hendry’s case she had the key symptoms that are linked to a burst aneurysm.","On 18th April 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Michelle Hendry.

Evidence from a toxicologist indicated that a chronically high level of fluoxetine may have led to arrhythmia in life and contributed to a collapse at the wheel.
 
Talia was prescribed Fluoxetine by her general practitioner on 22 December 2021 for anxiety. On 31 January 2022 Talia experienced an episode of palpitations and contacted her general practitioner who organised routine blood tests and an ECG. The tests and the ECG were reported as normal, save for slightly low iron levels.

Such a test may have identified chronically high levels of Fluoxetine.

Detailed factual findings in Security Sensitive form are held by MOD and I request that you should have regard to the full Security Sensitive factual findings.,"I have been greatly assisted by detailed evidence from MOD on the changes made to the relevant aspects of military diving training since Ben’s death. From that evidence it is very clear that there has been a comprehensive and far-reaching review of policies, practices and organisational structures which will have very significantly reduced the risk of future fatalities. In several areas, the changes made go beyond those recommended by the Defence Safety Authority, and in nearly all other cases the recommendations have been adequately addressed. There are a few areas where there remains technological limitations to the response to the earlier DSA recommendations , but I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard that appropriate technological advances are being rapidly sought, with the risks in the meantime being mitigated by other means. Among over thirty recommendations arising from earlier investigations where extensive action has already been taken, there are four discrete areas in relation to which I assess that the Statutory threshold for me to make a Report to Prevent Future Deaths is met. Accordingly, it is still the case that during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to conce rn. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you .
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(1)  A stand-by diver was present at the dive exercise and he was deployed to try to find and rescue Ben. However, the stand-by diver had to surface having run out of breathable gas before Ben was found. A spare breathing apparatus cylinder was not carried in the safety boat for the stand-by diver (or other divers) to use in the event that the stand-by diver’s main cylinder ran out.
 
(2)  The progression of the dive training in which Ben was engaged was safety-critical. The progression of training was accelerated for several reasons, one of which was a visit by a high-ranking naval officer. The concern of the instructing staff was to polish the drills ahead of that visit and to take the pressure off the dive students by allowing them to practise
the dive with relevant equipment ahead of the visit. This acceleration of safety-critical training in part because of such a visit was not appropriate.
 
(3)  Ben was lifted unconscious from the sea bed and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation was immediately started. A defibrillator was also applied, but this was only available because it was carried by a Harbour Patrol vessel which came to assist. I am concerned that in such safety-critical military diving training, the dive support staff did not have available to them a defibrillator of their own either on the supporting safety boats or on land. This did not cause or contribute to Ben’s death but could lead to future fatalities.
 
(4) There is an inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus as between the maintenance manual for which DE&S is responsible and all other policy and safety guidance.","On 26 November 2018 the Senior Coroner for Dorset commenced an investigation into the death of BENJAMIN DAVID MCQUEEN, aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held by me as nominated Judge Coroner from 10 to 28 July 2023. ","(1)   As to carrying a spare breathing apparatus cylinder in safety boats in addition to that carried by the stand-by diver where this is practicable, I am reassured that this appears to be happening in practice in Ben’s former unit. But I have a concern that this does not yet appear in policy guidance and it is a safety concern that may need to be more widely shared in defence.
 
(2)   As to avoiding visits by senior ranking Officers or VIP visitors to training courses leading to an acceleration of safety-critical training, I am reassured that action has been taken in Ben’s former unit such that this should not recur in relation to the relevant diving training. But I have a concern as to whether this has been shared more widely amongst other military units.
 
(3)   As to the availability of defibrillators, I was informed that they are present at some, but not all, dive sites used by Ben’s former Unit. The risk assessment suggesting that defibrillators are not required because of the age/health profile of those attending the diving training appears to focus upon the risk of myocardial infarction (or similar) from a natural cause or routine exercise, rather than the risk of cardiac arrest / heart arrythmias caused by traumatic injury when carrying out arduous military diving.
 
(4)   As to the inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus, I was informed that the relevant operators would not need to consult the detailed maintenance manual such that confusion should not occur. Nevertheless, I consider that in the sphere of safety-critical dive training, there is an unnecessary residual risk in different figures being given for the minimum safety pressure level for a type of diver’s breathing apparatus.
 
In relation to each of these areas, in my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you as the responsible Minister for the Ministry of Defence have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Friday 22 September 2023.

1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following.

There is no evidence that any acts or omissions in the care provided to him, contributed to his death. The chest radiograph was not sent for analysis until 8 March 2022. The lack of an alert did not therefore contribute to Akash’s death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
The Xray on the 28 February 2022, which was carried out following treatment for pneumonia, showed an obvious progression in lung consolidation and was highly suggestive of tuberculosis (a new clinical diagnosis). Akash was not an in-patient in hospital at the time of the follow-up Xray. He had been discharged and was therefore not under the active management of a clinical team. The inquest heard that such significant, unexpected, and important changes should have been highlighted to the referring clinician. This was not done. There does not appear to be a process in place for an alert to be added to the normal communication method to ensure that such significant, unexpected, and important findings are acted upon in a timely manner.
 
The inquest also heard that the incidence of TB is rising in certain areas of the UK and that it is important that radiologists recognise TB changes and that these are duly highlighted to the referrer.","On the 30 May 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Akash Dinesh Bhudia, age 28 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 May 2023. ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 July 2023.
